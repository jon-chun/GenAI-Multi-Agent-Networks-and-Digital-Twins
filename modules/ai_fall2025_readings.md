## Vibe Coding

* [Vibe Coding with Confidence — Itamar Friedman, Qodo (20:54) (6 Aug 2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n991Yxo1aOI)
**Outline: The Future of AI in Software Development – Vibe Coding with Confidence via CLI and Multi-Agent Workflows**

*Presented by Itar Friedman, CEO & Co-Founder of Kodto*

---

### I. Introduction
- **Speaker**: Itar Friedman, CEO and Co-Founder of Kodto
- **Topic**: The evolution of AI in software development, focusing on "vibe coding with confidence," the role of the Command Line Interface (CLI), and multi-agent workflows.
- **Audience Check**:
  - Asked audience if they’ve tried:
    - Cloud Code
    - Codci
    - Aides
  - Implies familiarity with AI coding tools among attendees.
- **Product Announcement**:
  - Kodto’s **CLI tool** was soft-launched **5 minutes before the talk**.
  - Available for installation and testing.
  - Feedback encouraged.
  - Limited capacity initially.

---

### II. Generations of AI for Developers
#### A. Gen 1.0: Autocomplete
- Tools: IDE plugins (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
- Function: Code completion, generating a few lines ahead.
- Limitation: Requires existing developer skills; not accessible to non-developers.
- Impact: Useful, but **not a game changer**.

#### B. Gen 2.0: Chat & Diagenetic Interfaces
- Tools: Chat-based AI (e.g., ChatGPT)
- Function: Enables junior developers to generate more code.
- Challenges:
  - Seniors/enterprise developers face increased code review burden.
  - Output often lacks quality and maintainability.
  - Requires heavy human oversight.

#### C. Gen 3.0: Multi-Agent Workflows (The Game Changer)
- **Core Idea**: Shift from chat-based interaction to **command-line-driven, end-to-end agent workflows**.
- Goal: Enable **vibe coding with confidence** — not just fast coding, but high-quality, maintainable, and reliable output.
- Key Enabler: **CLI as the new interface leader**.

---

### III. AI Across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
#### A. Beyond the IDE
- Current tools focus on coding *inside* IDEs.
- Future: AI must operate **across the entire SDLC**:
  1. Planning
  2. Code Generation
  3. Testing
  4. Code Review
- Need for **end-to-end, agentic workflows** that span these phases.

#### B. The "V" Shape of Development
- Typical workflow:
  1. **Planning** (non-executable)
  2. **Code Writing** (executable)
  3. **Testing** (executable, but not app code)
  4. **Review** (non-executable)
- **Game Changer**: Compress this "V" into a **holistic, automated flow** using AI agents.

---

### IV. The Problem with "Vibe Coding"
#### A. Origin and Backlash
- Term popularized by Karpathy (Andrej Karpathy).
- Initially celebrated as a fast, intuitive way to code with AI.
- **Quick backlash** within weeks/months:
  - Karpathy himself retracted, stating:  
    > “I actually and professionally care about code. Contrast: vibe code.”
- Criticisms:
  - Lacks quality, maintainability, and context.
  - Unsuitable for **large, existing codebases**.
  - Works well only for **greenfield projects**.

#### B. Requirements for "Vibe Coding with Confidence"
1. **Context Awareness**:
   - Must include project-specific context, best practices, architecture.
2. **Workflows**:
   - Structured, repeatable processes.
   - Integration with SDLC stages.
3. **Trust & Quality**:
   - Reliable code review, testing, and refactoring.
   - Enterprise-grade maintainability.

---

### V. Kodto’s Approach: Multi-Agent Architecture
#### A. Holistic AI Solution
- Focus on **end-to-end workflows**, not isolated tools.
- Designed for **enterprise-grade software**.

#### B. Key Agents & Tools
1. **Deep Research / Deep Ask Agent**:
   - Understands complex codebases.
   - Retrieves relevant context for accurate AI output.

2. **Code Review Agent (Flagship: "Code Merge")**:
   - Named: **Code Merge** (codto merge).
   - Collects and applies **organizational best practices** over time.
   - Ensures code quality and adherence to standards.

3. **Shift-Left Tool (IDE Integration)**:
   - Brings review and best practices **into the development phase**.
   - Prevents issues before code is pushed.

4. **Cover Agent (Open Source)**:
   - Automatically **increases test coverage**.
   - Integrated into CLI; no need to download separately.
   - GitHub: `github.com/kodto/cover` *(implied open-source)*

---

### VI. Why CLI is the Future
#### A. Advantages of CLI over IDE Plugins
- **Automation & Scripting**:
  - Can be integrated into CI/CD, pre-commit, post-commit hooks.
- **Pipelines & Composability**:
  - Supports **piping** agents together (e.g., generate → test → review).
  - Enables **workflow orchestration**.
- **Background Execution**:
  - Agents can run asynchronously.
- **Developer-Centric**:
  - Familiar to developers; supports complex, repeatable tasks.

#### B. Real-World Example: Simon’s Talk
- Speaker Simon demonstrated AI tools **entirely via CLI**.
- Proves CLI is powerful, flexible, and sufficient for advanced workflows.

#### C. Kodto CLI Tool
- **Just launched** (soft launch during talk).
- Features:
  - Chat interface with agents.
  - Ability to **create new agents on demand**.
  - Example: `create agent --goal="review code"`
  - Uses **MCP (Machine-Callable Protocols)** to discover capabilities.
  - Generates agents with:
    - Tools
    - Instructions
    - Output schema
- Can be extended and customized.

#### D. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication
- Vision: **Swarm of agents** working in parallel.
- Features:
  - Discoverability between agents.
  - Handshakes and shared context.
  - Parallel execution with coordination.
- **Current State**: Very few using A2A (only 1 person raised hand in audience).
- **Future Roadmap**: CLI-based A2A command system in development.

---

### VII. Demo & Workflow Example
#### A. Creating a Review Agent
- Command: `kodto create agent --goal="code review"`
- Process:
  - Initializes MCP.
  - Searches available tools and capabilities.
  - Generates agent definition (e.g., "merge review agent").
  - Agent is ready to use in seconds (vs. hours manually).

#### B. Using the Agent
- Command: `kodto merge review [target]`
- Features:
  - Applies **organizational best practices**.
  - Can include **success/failure criteria** (e.g., test coverage threshold).
  - Flexible input and output.

#### C. Pipeline Example
```bash
# Generate code → Increase test coverage → Review
kodto generate "new feature" | kodto cover | kodto merge review
```
- Demonstrates **composable, CLI-driven workflows**.

---

### VIII. The Future: Swarm of Agents
- **Vision**: A **swarm of specialized agents**, each with:
  - Unique credentials
  - Domain-specific knowledge
  - Best practices
- **Timeline**: Rapid development expected in **2025–2026**.
- **Interfaces**:
  - CLI as primary control plane.
  - **Dynamic UI generation** from CLI for specific tasks (e.g., code review interface).
  - May **reduce reliance on traditional IDEs**.

---

### IX. Conclusion
- **Current State**: AI tools are helpful but not game-changing.
- **Game Changer**: **Confident, end-to-end AI workflows** via CLI and multi-agent systems.
- **Kodto’s Role**:
  - Building a **holistic, agentic platform**.
  - Focusing on **quality, trust, and enterprise needs**.
- **Call to Action**:
  - Try the **new Kodto CLI tool** (soft-launched).
  - Follow Kodto for upcoming announcements (2-month roadmap).
  - Join the movement toward **AI-powered, CLI-driven development**.

---

### X. Supporting Details & References
- **Kodto CLI**: Available now (soft launch).
- **Kodto Cover (Open Source)**: `github.com/kodto/cover` *(implied)*
- **Key Concepts**:
  - MCP (Machine-Callable Protocols)
  - A2A (Agent-to-Agent Communication)
  - Shift-left testing & review
  - Vibe coding → Confident coding
- **Influencers Cited**:
  - **Andrej Karpathy** – On the evolution of "vibe coding".
  - **Simon** – Demonstrated CLI-first AI development (talk referenced but not named).

---

### XI. Final Message
> “We’re going into a future where we’re going to have a **swarm of agents**... and it’s coming really fast — 2025, 2026.”  
> — Itar Friedman, Kodto

## Project: Extracting Behavior

* [Kura implement CLIO](https://github.com/567-labs/kura)
Kura is a simple reproduction of the CLIO paper which uses language models to label user behaviour before clustering them based on embeddings recursively. This helps us understand user behaviour on a higher level without sacrificing PII


## 📚 &nbsp; Resources

- In addition to assessing the convergence of your agent's path, you can also analyze the failure probabilities of each step of your agent. Here's a [reference example](https://blog.langchain.dev/scipe-systematic-chain-improvement-and-problem-evaluation/) on how this can be done.
