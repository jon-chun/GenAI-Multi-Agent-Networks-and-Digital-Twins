# Week N: Week Title

After digging into the details of embeddings, vector databases, and various RAG optimization techniques this week we step back an look at the most popular high-level opinionated LLM development framework: LangChain. You will see how you can implement your RAG concepts from last week in a Chatbot and more broadly LLM applications using agents. Finally, you'll get a peek into the theory of recent agentic AI research that takes us a step closer to AGI.
