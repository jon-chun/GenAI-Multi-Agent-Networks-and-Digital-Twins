# Week 8: Langchain

After digging into the seamy details of embeddings, vector databases, and various RAG optimization techniques, this week we step back a high-level look at the most popular (and opinionated) LLM development framework: Langchain. You will see how you can implement your RAG concepts from last week in a Chatbot and more broadly use Langchain to create standalone LLM applications to networks of agents. Finally, you'll get a peek into the theory of recent agentic AI research that takes us a step closer to AGI.
