  Multi-GPU inference: for users with multiple GPUs, they can leverage sequence parallel to reduce the memory burden on each GPU. We provide an inference script here and hope to get feedback on how much GPU memory it saves. Inference with multiple gpus can also greatly reduce the inference time. For example, It only needs 2.5 min to generate a 5s, 768p, 24fps video when using 4 A100 for inference (versus 5.5 min in one A100).
