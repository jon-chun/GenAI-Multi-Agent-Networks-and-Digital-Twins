Just a few tips:
* find a paper
- semanticscholar.org
- arxiv.org
* ask a series of questions
("summarize in outline form", "what does <X> mean", "how does this relate to <X>", "what is the current state of the art research in <X> and how does this paper contribute to it", "give a ranked list in descending order of the main strengths and weaknesses of this paper", etc)

- phind.com
- OpenAI o1 model
* use visualizations tools 
- https://www.napkin.ai/
- OpenAI can create images/diagrams/etc from text prompts (using Dalle3/X)
