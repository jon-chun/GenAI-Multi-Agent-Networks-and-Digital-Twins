# Research Paper Presentations

## Scope of Assignment

Search for a recent interdisciplinary AI research paper in a area of your study, interest, or experience to present to the class. Your presentation will be timed for 5mins so plan for at most ~5 slides. Adjust your content and technical assumptions to the level of your classmates to include everyone.

Email your research paper and slide presentation to chunj@kenyon.edu a day or two before your scheduled presentation.

## Tools/Tips

### Finding a current research paper

* semanticscholar.org (best search engine)
* arxiv.org (most recent/comprehensive open/preprint archive)
* scholar.google.com (comprehensive, but poor search and noisy)

### Summarize/Outline Research Paper

* notebooklm.google.com (Summaries, outlines, FAQs, etc)

### Related research and AI follow-up dialog

- [Phind.com](https://phind.com) Great FREE research and Q&A follow-up functionality with citations
- [perplexity.com](https://perplexity.com) Like Phind.com, but free version more limited

Use these resources to ask a series of questions, drill down into details, and engage with the material on a more custom/personalized level. At the end of each response, both Phind and Perplexity will list suggested follow-up questions to take you deeper into the paper, topic, research, etc. 

For example, ask questions on particular points like:
    
- "what is the current state of the art research in <X> and how does this paper contribute to it"
- "summarize in outline form"
- "what does <X> mean"
- "how does <X> relate to <Y> in the context of/within the constraits of <Z>"
- "give a ranked list in descending order of the main strengths and weaknesses of this paper"
- etc...

### Create Presentation Slides/Visuals

- [Napkin.ai](https://www.napkin.ai/) creates a wide variety of typical diagrams/figures
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com] can create images/diagrams/etc from text prompts (using Dalle3 on the backend)
