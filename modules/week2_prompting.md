# Week 2: Prompt Engineering, Vibe Coding and Context Engineering

"Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb" - Calvin Coolidge

### Readings

* [Demis Hassabis On The Future of Work in the Age of AI (20:10) (Jul 2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRraHg4Ks_g)

### Reflection:

Theme 1: The Future of Work in the Age of AI

Impact on Human Roles: Based on Demis Hassabis’s insights, how might AI reshape traditional job roles, and what new opportunities or challenges could emerge for workers in fields like education, healthcare, or the arts? How should society prepare for these shifts?
Human-AI Collaboration: Hassabis likely discusses AI as a tool for augmenting human work. What are the ethical implications of humans and AI systems collaborating closely in professional settings? How can we ensure that human agency and creativity remain central?
Economic Inequality: How might AI-driven automation exacerbate or mitigate economic inequality? Discuss potential strategies to ensure equitable access to AI-driven opportunities, especially in rural or underserved communities like those near Kenyon College.
Education and Skill Development: What changes should educational institutions, like Kenyon College, make to prepare students for an AI-driven workforce? Should liberal arts education adapt to emphasize skills that complement AI, such as critical thinking or emotional intelligence?
Work-Life Balance: How might AI’s influence on productivity and efficiency, as discussed by Hassabis, affect work-life balance? Could AI lead to shorter workweeks or, conversely, increased pressure to be “always on”?

### AI Research

This will be an exercise in skimming and using AI to analyze and quickly grasp the fundamentals of an AI research paper. Do not worry if many terms or concepts appear alien to you now. In fact, this is unfamiliarity is key to demonstrating how to leverage AI to personalize and accelerate your learning. Over the next 14 weeks you will master the core concepts in this paper, but for now this opacity is a precondition to demonstrate the efficacy of AI-assisted learning. 

- Read "Abstract" on page 1
- Read from section 1 (middle page 4) to section 3.1 (bottom page 7)
- Read from section 4 (bottom page 12) to 4.1 with Fig 3 (top of page 13), but stop before 4.1.1
- Read from section 4.3 (bottom page 23 to middle page 24), but stop before 4.3.2
- Read section 8 Conclusion on page 58.
   
From these 8 pages as reference points, I'll dissect this paper for you in class. More importantly, we'll learn a methodology to use AI to query, explain, and enter into dialog with contents and concepts of this paper. This is an invaluable skill that generalizes far beyond this particular AI research paper.
