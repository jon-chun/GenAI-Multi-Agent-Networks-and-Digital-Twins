# Week 3: Miniproject #1 Chatbot

As AI models like GPT have become more powerful, they've also become more accessible through APIs. This week, we'll explore the basics of using Python to interact with the OpenAI API, enabling us to harness the power of large language models in our own applications.

## Key Questions to Consider

1. How does API access to AI models democratize AI development?
2. What are the ethical considerations when using AI models through APIs?
3. How can we ensure responsible use of AI APIs in application development?
4. What are the limitations of current AI APIs, and how might they evolve in the future?
5. How does prompt engineering affect the output of AI models accessed through APIs?
6. What are the potential risks of relying too heavily on AI-generated content in applications?
7. How might the widespread use of AI APIs impact job markets and skill requirements in tech?
8. What role does data privacy play when using AI APIs, and how can we protect user information?
9. How can we balance the benefits of AI APIs with the need for transparency and explainability?
10. What are the long-term implications of integrating AI APIs into critical systems and decision-making processes?
