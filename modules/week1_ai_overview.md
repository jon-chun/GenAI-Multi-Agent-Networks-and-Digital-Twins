# Week 1: Introduction to AI

This course is the third in a sequence of human-centered AI courses that:

1. build an intellectual framework for understanding and integrating human-centered AI abstractions from traditional AI Digital Humanities perspectives including the Humanities, Social Sciences and Arts,

2. explore and survey the intersection of AI, academics and industry

3. authentic assessments using SOTA AI research, models and methods to explore automating or agumenting knowledge workflows using automated agent networks.

We begin with standard course bookkeeping followed by laying both a foundation and giving framework of guiding concepts:

1. What is 'Artificial Intelligence' (AGI, ASI, etc.)?
2. What are current perceptions, beliefs and expectations?
3. Survey current SOTA multimodal AI models.
4. What is the trajectory and pace of AI innovation, investments and productization?

### Readings

* [Demis Hassabis On The Future of Work in the Age of AI (20:10) (Jul 2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRraHg4Ks_g)
* [Why consciousness is software, and software is spirit | Joscha Bach (20:19) (Apr 2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E361FZ_50oo)

### Reflection:

Theme 1: The Future of Work in the Age of AI

Impact on Human Roles: Based on Demis Hassabis’s insights, how might AI reshape traditional job roles, and what new opportunities or challenges could emerge for workers in fields like education, healthcare, or the arts? How should society prepare for these shifts?
Human-AI Collaboration: Hassabis likely discusses AI as a tool for augmenting human work. What are the ethical implications of humans and AI systems collaborating closely in professional settings? How can we ensure that human agency and creativity remain central?
Economic Inequality: How might AI-driven automation exacerbate or mitigate economic inequality? Discuss potential strategies to ensure equitable access to AI-driven opportunities, especially in rural or underserved communities like those near Kenyon College.
Education and Skill Development: What changes should educational institutions, like Kenyon College, make to prepare students for an AI-driven workforce? Should liberal arts education adapt to emphasize skills that complement AI, such as critical thinking or emotional intelligence?
Work-Life Balance: How might AI’s influence on productivity and efficiency, as discussed by Hassabis, affect work-life balance? Could AI lead to shorter workweeks or, conversely, increased pressure to be “always on”?

Theme 2: Consciousness, Software, and Spirit

Defining Consciousness: Joscha Bach suggests consciousness is akin to software or spirit. What does this metaphor imply about the nature of human consciousness? Do you agree with this framing, and why or why not?
AI and Consciousness: If consciousness is software, as Bach proposes, could AI ever achieve a form of consciousness? Discuss the philosophical and ethical implications of creating AI systems that mimic or possess consciousness.
Human Identity: How does Bach’s perspective challenge traditional notions of human identity and spirituality? In what ways might viewing consciousness as software influence our understanding of free will or moral responsibility?
AI as a Mirror: Bach’s talk might suggest that building AI forces us to reflect on our own minds. How can studying AI’s “software-like” processes deepen our understanding of human cognition, emotions, or creativity?
Ethical Boundaries: If software can be considered “spirit,” what ethical boundaries should guide the development of AI systems that simulate human-like traits? Should there be limits to how “human” AI can become?

Theme 3: Human-Centered AI and Society

Balancing Efficiency and Humanity: Drawing from both videos, how can AI be designed to prioritize human well-being over pure efficiency or profit? What role should institutions like Kenyon College play in advocating for human-centered AI?
Cultural Implications: How might AI’s influence on work (Hassabis) and its potential to emulate consciousness (Bach) reshape cultural values, such as community, creativity, or spirituality, in liberal arts settings like Kenyon?
Bias and Fairness: Both videos likely touch on AI’s societal impact. How can we address biases in AI systems to ensure they serve diverse populations equitably? Discuss examples of potential biases in AI applications related to work or consciousness.
Moral Agency in AI Design: Combining Hassabis’s and Bach’s perspectives, who should bear responsibility for the societal consequences of AI—developers, policymakers, or users? How can interdisciplinary fields like IPHS contribute to ethical AI design?
Future Visions: Imagine a future where AI transforms work (per Hassabis) and consciousness is better understood as software (per Bach). What would a human-centered society look like in this context, and how can we steer AI development toward that vision?
