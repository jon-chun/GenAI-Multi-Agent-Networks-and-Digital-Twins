# Week 1: Introduction to AI

This course is the third in a sequence of human-centered AI courses that:

1. build an intellectual framework for understanding and integrating human-centered AI abstractions from traditional AI Digital Humanities perspectives including the Humanities, Social Sciences and Arts,

2. explore and survey the intersection of AI, academics and industry

3. authentic assessments using SOTA AI research, models and methods to explore automating or agumenting knowledge workflows using automated agent networks.

We begin with standard course bookkeeping followed by laying both a foundation and giving framework of guiding concepts:

1. What is 'Artificial Intelligence' (AGI, ASI, etc.)?
2. What are current perceptions, beliefs and expectations?
3. Survey current SOTA multimodal AI models.
4. What is the trajectory and pace of AI innovation, investments and productization?
