## Overview

To the best of our knowledge, IPHS developed the world's first human-centered AI curriculum and interdisciplinary computing program centered around the big questions arising out traditional humanistic enquiry (IPHS100 Odyssey). This course is the third in a sequence of human-centered AI courses that:

1. Build an intellectual framework for understanding and integrating human-centered AI abstractions from traditional AI Digital Humanities perspectives including the Humanities, Social Sciences and Arts,

2. Explore and survey the intersection of (1) traditional academics, (2) AI Reseearch, and (3) Best practices in industry

3. See entire research and industry pipeline from research design to authentic assessments using SOTA AI research, models and methods to explore automating or agumenting knowledge workflows using automated agent networks.

We begin with standard course bookkeeping followed by laying both a foundation and giving framework of guiding concepts like:

- What is 'Artificial Intelligence' (AGI, ASI, etc.)?
- What are current perceptions, beliefs and expectations?
- Survey current SOTA multimodal AI models.
- What is the trajectory and pace of AI innovation, investments and productization?

### Reflection Questions

* Theme 1: AI as a Civilization-Shaping Force
  * How is AI reshaping labor, creativity, and society, and what excites or concerns you about these changes in your field of study?
  * What role should liberal arts institutions like Kenyon College play in advocating for human-centered AI development?
  * How might AI-driven automation create new opportunities or challenges in fields like medicine, law, literature, or policy?
  * What ethical considerations should guide the design of AI systems that collaborate closely with humans?

* Theme 2: The Future of Work and Knowledge Automation
  * What jobs might exist in 2035 that don’t exist today, and how could AI contribute to their emergence?
  * Which tasks in your field could AI automate, and which human skills will remain irreplaceable?
  * How might AI’s influence on productivity affect work-life balance, potentially leading to shorter workweeks or increased pressure?
  * What ethical risks (e.g., bias, privacy) must we address as AI automates knowledge work in your discipline?
  * Should AI’s societal impact, such as potential job displacement, necessitate policies like Universal Basic Income by 2030?

* Theme 3: AI and Interdisciplinary Innovation
  * How can AI bridge traditional academic divisions (e.g., humanities, sciences) to solve real-world problems?
  * What are the benefits and challenges of applying AI to fields like literature, policy, or art, as seen in past IPHS projects?
  * How can diverse student backgrounds in this class foster cross-pollination of ideas for innovative AI applications?
  * What societal impacts could arise from AI projects like those in this course (e.g., AI for disability services, stock selection, fashion trend analysis)?
  * How can your final project contribute to the broader field of AI or its applications in your area of interest?
