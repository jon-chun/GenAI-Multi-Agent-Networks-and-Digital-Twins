# Week 11: Multiagents

We continue to build upon our abstraction stack this week by studying two higher level multi-agent frameworks. This includes CrewAI which is a high-level abstraction layer around LangChain and the new OpenAI Swarm multi-agent framework launched last month. Although the latter is still in experimental stage, it's has an unfair, sustained competitive advantage being the brainchild of OpenAI itself and proposes a lighter, perhaps more intuitive framework.

We'll also explore the "New Economics in the AI World" by VC Vinod Khosla who has perhaps one of the most extensive, largely positive, advocacy/prediction pieces. Finally, we'll look at a recent research survey paper that gives a brief overview of Autonomous AI Frameworks.
