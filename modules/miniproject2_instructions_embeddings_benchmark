1) Pick 5 candidate domains now; we’ll choose your best 3

Bring five domain ideas to class; we will select three for you to actually build.
Functional definition of domain expertise (flexible, human-centric): you can reliably spot edge cases and rank similarity of domain texts better than most people because of your background (major, language/culture, work, clubs, lived experience, community ties, etc.). You don’t need formal credentials.

Examples to spark ideas (non-exhaustive)

Academic genres (methods sections, critique notes, problem-set solutions)

Bureaucratic language (visa instructions, campus policy, financial-aid emails)

Niche hobbies/subcultures (climbing trip reports, K-pop fan posts, tabletop RPG rules clarifications)

Technical writing (lab safety notes, API docs snippets, commit messages)

Creative forms (poetry lines, workshop feedback, indie music reviews)

Health/fitness (training logs, diet tips, PT exercise instructions)

Multilingual/dialectal (code-switching chat, regional idioms, transliterated content)

Journalism/register shifts (wire headlines vs. feature ledes)

Civic/legal plain-language explanations (de-identified)

We’ll coordinate across the class to avoid redundancy and to maximize coverage.

2) What “similar” vs. “different” means (use these axes creatively)

You’ll label pairs and label triplet sentences relative to an anchor. Drop the fuzzy neutral category.

Think in dimensions; use them to invent edge cases:

Semantic: same meaning despite wording changes (true paraphrase) vs. opposite/irrelevant meanings.

Trick: negation (“must” vs. “must not”), quantifiers (“some” vs. “all”).

Topical: same subject but different claim or stance is often different semantically (topic ≠ meaning).

Lexical: shared keywords but divergent meaning (false friends, polysemy) vs. low overlap but same meaning (deep paraphrase).

Stylistic/Register: formal vs. informal; academic vs. chatty; sarcasm/irony. Style can mask or mimic semantics.

Pragmatic/Contextual: implied intents, politeness strategies, presuppositions.

World knowledge: allusions, culture-specific references, inside jokes.

Temporal/Numerical/Logical: tense shifts, date/price/unit changes; conditionals versus factual statements.

Goal: at least half of your hard items should hinge on subtle distinctions that confuse non-experts and today’s AIs.
