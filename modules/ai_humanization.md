* Level of Rewording: Moderate rewording with 50 word swaps, altering key phrases and simplifying the language.

* Sentence Complexity: Simplified structure, using shorter, more direct sentences (e.g., "Make your AI-generated material sound more human").

* Tone Shift: Less formal and more casual, with phrases like "Be unique 100 unique" and "improve your content."

* Factual Preservation: Key information is retained but simplified (e.g., "effortlessly converts" became "easily converts").

* Naturalness: More casual and approachable, though some phrasing feels slightly awkward (e.g., "Be unique 100 unique").
