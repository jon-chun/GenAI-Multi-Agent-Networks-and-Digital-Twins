### Strategies

* [26 Key Takeaways from Building 150+ Agents in 9 months (30:07) (21 Feb 2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmeGqDu4tPU)
I'll summarize the 26 key takeaways about AI agents from the text:

AI agents are not employees - They have less autonomy and typically handle one SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) versus employees who handle multiple SOPs.

Start with well-documented processes - Use existing SOPs to make agent training simpler and more effective.

Business owners won't build their own agents - Even with advanced tools, they'll rely on AI agent developers.

Business owners often don't know which agents they need - Start by mapping customer journeys to find valuable automation opportunities.

Don't overcomplicate with too many agents - Start small, preferably with one agent, then scale up after testing.

Combine data with actions - Agents perform best when given both knowledge and ability to take action.

Prompt engineering is crucial - Use examples, consider order of instructions, and test continuously.

Integrations are as important as functionality - Agents must work within existing systems.

Agent reliability can be solved - Use Penic (data validation library) to validate inputs/outputs.

Tools are the most important component - Actions, not just responses, provide value.

Limit tools per agent - Keep to 4-6 tools per agent to prevent confusion and hallucination.

Model costs don't matter - Focus on ROI rather than per-request costs.

Clients don't care about which model you use - They care about results and compliance.

Don't automate until value is established - Test processes manually first.

Focus on ROI - Use formula: (Rate ร Hours - Operational Costs) รท Development Costs.

Agent development is iterative - Test different approaches to find what works best.

Use divide and conquer approach - Break down complex problems into manageable tasks.

Evals matter more for large companies - Small businesses may not need sophisticated evaluation metrics.

There are two types of agents - Traditional agents and agentic workflows.

Agents need adaptable feedback - Include tools for analyzing results and impact.

Don't build around current limitations - Models will improve; avoid temporary workarounds.

Deployment is harder than building - Integration into client processes takes longer than development.

Avoid waterfall projects - Use subscription-based, agile approach for agent development.

Include human oversight for critical tasks - Use human-in-the-loop for high-stakes processes.

2025 will be the year of vertical AI agents - Industry-specific agents will become more important.

Agents don't replace people - They help businesses scale and allow employees to focus on higher-level tasks.
