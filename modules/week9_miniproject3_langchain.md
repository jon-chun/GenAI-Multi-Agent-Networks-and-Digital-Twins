# Week 9: More LangChain, LangGraph and Miniproject #3

We learn more LangChain API details for robuts AI application development along with it's agentic framework LangGraph. With these additional two skillsets, you have more degrees of freedom to design a more creative Miniproject #3 that utilizes LangChain/LangGraph to automate a non-trivial knowledge work pipeline. Start with 1-3 of the many LangChain/LangGraph sample applications and customize the workflow with LangChain components, architecture, datasets, prompts, and details like algorithms. Pick a workflow that parallels a non-trival task you have special insight and/or interest in from producing a viral music video to writing a specialized inside-the-beltway policy paper to automate AI dataset creation (search, download, normalization, filtering, etc).
