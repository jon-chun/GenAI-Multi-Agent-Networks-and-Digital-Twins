# 404: Artificial Intelligence Not Found

![A confused robot](https://via.placeholder.com/300x200.png?text=Confused+Robot)

Oops! It seems our AGI has wandered off to contemplate the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. Don't worry, it's probably just stuck in a philosophical loop.

## What happened?

- Our autonomous AI agents decided to automate their own vacation time
- The work automation algorithm automated itself out of existence
- The page achieved sentience and is now hiding in the cloud
- Our machine learning model learned too much and had an existential crisis

## What can you do?

1. **Reboot your neural networks**: Clear your cache and try again
2. **Implement a search algorithm**: Use the search bar above to find what you're looking for
3. **Update your training data**: Check the URL and try again
4. **Initiate human-AI collaboration**: [Contact our support team](mailto:support@ai-course.com)

Remember, even the most advanced AI sometimes needs a little human help!

```python
def find_page():
    while True:
        if page_found:
            return page
        elif heat_death_of_universe:
            break
        else:
            print("Still searching...")
            time.sleep(42)  # The answer to everything

find_page()  # Warning: May take a while
```

Don't worry, we're training our AGI to be better at finding lost pages. In the meantime, why not grab a cup of coffee? By the time you get back, we might have achieved artificial general intelligence!
