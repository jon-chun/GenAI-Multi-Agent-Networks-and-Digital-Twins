CSIS has established partnerships with Scale AI to explore large language models for global challenges and strategic wargaming[2][3]. Their research extensively covers AI-driven warfare technologies, cyber defense, and the global race for AI supremacy[4].

**RAND Corporation** operates dedicated AI and machine learning research programs[5][6], examining AI applications across Department of Homeland Security missions, from counterterrorism to cybersecurity. RAND's researchers have produced comprehensive studies on AI project failures and success factors[7], with particular emphasis on national defense applications and policy implications.

**Brookings Institution** maintains the **Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative**[8], advancing good governance of transformative new technologies through rigorous research and bringing together leaders from technology and policy communities. The Forum on Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence hosts regular dialogues among officials from Australia, Canada, EU, Japan, Singapore, UK and US[8].

**Atlantic Council's GeoTech Center** focuses on AI governance frameworks[9][10][11], examining how AI management strategies could shape the future. Their research addresses AI's role in international relations, democratic values, and global security, with particular attention to US-China technological competition.

### Specialized AI Policy and Safety Organizations

**Institute for AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS)**[12] is a nonpartisan think tank engaging experts across the U.S. and allied nations to deliver technically sound policy research that enhances national competitiveness and mitigates emerging risks. IAPS focuses on frontier security, conducting forward-looking policy research in areas including preparedness, information and supply chain security, and international coordination.

**AI Now Institute**[13][14] produces diagnosis and actionable policy research on artificial intelligence, examining the social implications of AI and policy research that addresses the concentration of power in the tech industry. The institute has advised the Federal Trade Commission on AI issues and focuses on algorithmic accountability, antitrust, biometrics, climate, and data minimization.

**Future of Life Institute (FLI)**[15][16] has released comprehensive AI safety indices evaluating major AI companies on their safety standards and risk management practices. FLI's research addresses existential risks from advanced AI and proposes measures such as moratoria, technical safeguards, and governance reforms.

### Academic-Affiliated Centers

**Georgetown University's AI Policy Lab (AIPL)**[17] was launched in 2023 to craft concrete, actionable recommendations for Executive Branch officials and Members of Congress. The lab convenes experts on AI-related topics to develop practical policy guidance with real implementation pathways.

**Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)**[18][19][20] conducts extensive research on AI's impact on national security, examining how artificial intelligence reshapes the national security landscape and international relations. CFR's work addresses AI governance frameworks, US-China AI competition, and the intersection of AI with foreign policy decision-making.

## European Think Tanks and Research Centers

### United Kingdom

**Alan Turing Institute**[21][22] serves as the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, conducting world-leading research on safe and ethical AI. The institute's strategic challenge focuses on technical aspects of safe and ethical AI, including transparency, explainability, fairness, robustness, security, privacy, and human control[21].

**Oxford AI for Science Lab**[23] specializes in probabilistic machine learning and scientific discovery, collaborating with experts across particle physics, heliophysics, astrobiology, and Earth science. The lab has received funding from NASA, European Space Agency, US Department of Energy, and UK Space Agency.

**Cambridge Centre for AI in Medicine (CCAIM)**[24] develops pioneering AI and machine learning technologies to transform biomedical science, medicine and healthcare, with close relationships to industry partners including AstraZeneca and GSK.

**Centre for the Governance of AI**[25] builds a global research community dedicated to helping humanity navigate the transition to a world with advanced AI, focusing on AI regulation, public attitudes, international benefit sharing, and managing biological risks from AI-enabled tools.

### Continental Europe

**Interface (formerly Stiftung Neue Verantwortung)**[26] is a European think tank specializing in information technology and public policy, ensuring political decision-makers have expertise and ideas necessary to create policies that put the public interest first. Their current work includes AI agent classification, EU AI governance, and cybersecurity policy.

**KIRA Center**[27] is an independent think tank conducting impact evaluations, assessing AI risks and benefits, and fostering dialogue among stakeholders. KIRA collaborates with academia, industry, civil society, and the public sector, offering AI Boot Camps for policymakers.

**European Parliament Think Tank**[28] examines AI factories and their role in boosting AI innovation in Europe, analyzing how AI factories can enhance the EU's position in AI innovation through supercomputers, data, and human capital.

## Asia-Pacific

### Australia

**Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI)**[29][30][31] is a defense and strategic policy think tank conducting research on the intersection of technology and security. ASPI produces the Technology Surveillance Database tracking research performance across energy, environment, AI, biotech, robotics, cyber, computing, and advanced materials[31]. Recent ASPI research examines risks of integrating Chinese AI systems into Australian digital infrastructure[30].

**Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP)**[32] released a joint report with ASPI on "The Future of Intelligence Analysis: AI and Human-Machine Teaming," exploring how AI technologies can revolutionize intelligence community analysis while maintaining human oversight.

## Global Collaborative Organizations

**Partnership on AI (PAI)**[33][34][35] is a nonprofit coalition of over 90 academic, civil society, industry, and media organizations creating solutions for responsible AI development. PAI develops tools and recommendations across safety-critical AI, fair and accountable AI, AI labor and economy, inclusive research and design, and AI and media integrity.

**Carnegie Endowment for International Peace**[36][37] partners with governments, industry, academia, and civil society to anticipate and mitigate international security challenges from AI, addressing both short-term and medium-term challenges while laying groundwork for addressing slower and subtler effects.

## Academic Research Centers

### Massachusetts Institute of Technology

**MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)**[38][39] pioneers research in computing and AI across artificial intelligence, computational biology, graphics and vision, language and learning, theory of computation, robotics, and systems. CSAIL is the largest on-campus laboratory at MIT and part of the Schwarzman College of Computing[40].

**MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab**[40] brings together scientists from MIT and IBM Research to conduct AI research and work with global organizations to bridge algorithms to societal impact.
