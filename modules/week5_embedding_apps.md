# Week 2: Prompt Engineering and OpenAI API Basics

As AI models like GPT have become more powerful, they've also become more accessible through APIs. This week, we'll explore the basics of using Python to interact with the OpenAI API, enabling us to harness the power of large language models in our own applications.

## Key Questions to Consider:

## Reading Assignments:

### Required Cloud Sign-Ups and Laptop Setups

Follow-the instructions as best you can to setup remote AI cloud services and configure your local laptop. DO NOT generate an API key yet - we'll do this in class with safeguards to prevent excess billings. Bring any questions/problems to class and we'll fix it during our break.

## Focus on These Concepts

# WARNING

BE VERY CAREFUL WITH PAID API SERVICE like OpenAI - costs can run up quickly with excessive use and coding errors. Set-up safe maximum usage limits $5-10 that you can bump up over the course of the semester.

Remember to review the API usage guidelines and rate limits to ensure responsible use of the OpenAI API. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please ask in class or contact the instructor via email.
