# Week 4: Embeddings

Embedding is a mathematical transformation of information from a given modality (text, image, etc) into a semantically vector space. It has multiple advantages including semantic operations like similiarity, distance metrics, smooth continous space for optimzation, jointly embedding multimodal information, etc. We'll explain these advantages this week, which turn out to be fairly intuitive, with multiple illustrations and coding examples.

## Key Questions to Consider

1. How do embeddings transform raw data into a more useful semantic vector space?
2. What are the key advantages of using embeddings in machine learning and AI applications?
3. How can embeddings be used to measure semantic similarity between different pieces of information?
4. What are the ethical considerations when using embeddings to represent and analyze human-generated 1. content?
5. How do embeddings enable multimodal learning, and what are the potential applications of this capability?
6. What are the current limitations of embedding techniques, and how might they be improved in the future?
7. How does the quality of the initial data affect the resulting embeddings, and what steps can be taken to 1. ensure high-quality embeddings?
8. What role do embeddings play in transfer learning and how might this impact the democratization of AI 1. development?
9. How can we ensure the interpretability and explainability of AI systems that rely heavily on embeddings?
10. What are the potential long-term implications of widespread use of embedding techniques in various 1. industries and decision-making processes?

# WARNING:

BE VERY CAREFUL WITH PAID API SERVICE like OpenAI - costs can run up quickly with excessive use and coding errors. Set-up safe maximum usage limits $5-10 that you can bump up over the course of the semester.

Remember to review the API usage guidelines and rate limits to ensure responsible use of the OpenAI API. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please ask in class or contact the instructor via email.

## In-Class Programming Task:
Create a Python script that uses the OpenAI API to generate a short story based on user input. The script should:

1. Prompt the user for a genre, setting, and main character
2. Use these inputs to craft an appropriate prompt for the OpenAI API
3. Make an API call to generate a short story
4. Display the generated story to the user
5. Implement error handling for API failures or rate limit issues

Submit your code and a brief report discussing your experience, challenges faced, and potential ethical considerations of your application.
