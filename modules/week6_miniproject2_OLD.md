# Week 6: Miniproject #2, Claude Code and Microsoft AI Toolkit

This week we explore Anthropic's new releases of model Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Code 2.0 as well as dig into the details of Microsofts VSCode extension AI Toolkit. Both of these are complimentary and will help us execute on Mini-Project #2: Embeddings Benchmark. In class, we'll use these tools (and possibly more) to flesh out the main aspects of our class research project.

## Mini-Project #2: Embedding Research (Upcoming)

Miniproject #2 will have you create a 3 novel dataset of 100 test sets each (2-3 sentences for similarity classification/ranking along with accompanying explanatory reasoning) across diverse domains. Do not proceed beyond the brainstorming and identification of the top 5 possible domains you could serve as a domain expert as defined below. In our next class on Oct 1st, we will coordinate among everyone's lists to optimize the final individual and collective assignments. For now, just read the following descriptions and brainstorm (with AI) at least 5 domain-specific areas where you can contribute special expertise/insights.

1) Pick 5 candidate domains now; we’ll choose your best 3
---------------------------------------------------------

Bring **five** domain ideas to class; we will select **three** for you to actually build.  
**Functional definition of domain expertise (flexible, human-centric):** you can reliably spot **edge cases** and **rank similarity** of domain texts **better than most people** because of your background (major, language/culture, work, clubs, lived experience, community ties, etc.). You don’t need formal credentials.

**Examples to spark ideas (non-exhaustive)**

*   Academic genres (methods sections, critique notes, problem-set solutions)
*   Bureaucratic language (visa instructions, campus policy, financial-aid emails)
*   Niche hobbies/subcultures (climbing trip reports, K-pop fan posts, tabletop RPG rules clarifications)
*   Technical writing (lab safety notes, API docs snippets, commit messages)
*   Creative forms (poetry lines, workshop feedback, indie music reviews)
*   Health/fitness (training logs, diet tips, PT exercise instructions)
*   Multilingual/dialectal (code-switching chat, regional idioms, transliterated content)
*   Journalism/register shifts (wire headlines vs. feature ledes)
*   Civic/legal plain-language explanations (de-identified)

We’ll coordinate across the class to avoid redundancy and to maximize coverage.


2) What “similar” vs. “different” means (use these axes creatively)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You’ll **label pairs** and **label triplet sentences relative to an anchor**. Drop the fuzzy _neutral_ category.

Think in **dimensions**; use them to invent **edge cases**:

*   **Semantic**: same meaning despite wording changes (true paraphrase) vs. opposite/irrelevant meanings.
    *   _Trick:_ negation (“must” vs. “must not”), quantifiers (“some” vs. “all”).
*   **Topical**: same subject but different **claim** or **stance** is often **different** semantically (topic ≠ meaning).
*   **Lexical**: shared keywords but divergent meaning (false friends, polysemy) vs. low overlap but same meaning (deep paraphrase).
*   **Stylistic/Register**: formal vs. informal; academic vs. chatty; sarcasm/irony. Style can mask or mimic semantics.
*   **Pragmatic/Contextual**: implied intents, politeness strategies, presuppositions.
*   **World knowledge**: allusions, culture-specific references, inside jokes.
*   **Temporal/Numerical/Logical**: tense shifts, date/price/unit changes; conditionals versus factual statements.

**Goal:** at least half of your hard items should hinge on **subtle distinctions** that confuse non-experts and today’s AIs.
