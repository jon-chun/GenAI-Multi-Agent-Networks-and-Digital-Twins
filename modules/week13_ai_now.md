# Week N: Week Title

This week we introduce our fourth and final Agentic Framework in Microsoft's AutoGen related to the taste of recently released Magentic-One reasoning-focused framework by MS. Although these are both in early releases and AutoGen is currently between stable 0.2 and a entire rewritten 0.4 version it's important to understand the new perspectives they given on automated knowledge workflow given MS's dominance and strategy in unifying AI across operating systems, applications, and developer resources (e.g. compilers, VSCode IDE, Github).
