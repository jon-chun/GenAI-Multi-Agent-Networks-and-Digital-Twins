# Week N: Week Title

This week we introduce our fourth and final Agentic Framework in Microsoft's AutoGen related to the taste of recently released Magentic-One reasoning-focused framework by MS. Unlike previous weeks, we will focus on the fundamentals and well as future direction rather than coding Agents. The one coding exercise for AutoGen version 0.2 should feel intuitive at this point.

Although MS AutoGen and Magentic-One are both in early release with AutoGen between stable release version 0.2 and a entire rewritten version 0.4, it's important to understand Microsoft's approach to agentic software engineering. Microsoft has been astounding agile around AI for it's size so we also study their views on automated knowledge workflow given MS's dominance and unique strategy in unifying AI across operating systems, applications, and developer resources (e.g. compilers, VSCode IDE, Github).

## Ideas for Final Projects

Cut down versions of AI products/startups with customized: (a) workflows, (b) datasources, (c) prompts, (d) models, (e) internal logic/processing, (f) un/structured output, (g) visualizations, (h) tools/outputs (e.g. focused search, fact checking, summarization, analysis, emails, etc):
