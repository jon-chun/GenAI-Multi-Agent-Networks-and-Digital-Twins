### Summary of Claude Code Features

####Managing Project Memory

* /init: Claude Code scans your codebase and creates CLAUDE.md file inside your project directory.

- CLAUDE.md guides Claude through your codebase, pointing out important commands, architecture and coding style. It's automatically included in the context each time you launch Claude Code.
- Here's an [example](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/ragchatbot-codebase/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) of a CLAUDE.md file generated by init for the RAG chatbot example.

* #: Use # to quickly add a memory. Useful when you see Claude Code repeats an error.

* **Example 1:** since the project is a uv project, we added these to CLAUDE.md file using #:
#use uv to run python files or add any dependencies

* **Example 2:** you can inform Claude Code about the database schema, in this case since you have a vector database, you can inform Claude Code about the collections stored in the vector database:

- #The vector database has two collections:
  * course_catalog:
stores course titles for name resolution
metadata for each course: title, instructor, course_link, lesson_count, lessons_json (list of lessons: lesson_number, lesson_title, lesson_link)
  * course_content:
stores text chunks for semantic search
metadata for each chunk: course_title, lesson_number, chunk_index

### Summary of Claude Code Commands

Command	Description
/clear	clears current conversation history
/compact	summarizes current conversation history
ESC	interrupt Claude to redirect or correct it
ESC ESC	rewind the conversation to an earlier point in time
@	Mention files with @ to include its content in your request
/mcp	Manage MCP connection & check available MCP servers with their provided tools (MCP with Claude Code)
You can use regular bash command within Claude Code, but you need to start the command with ! (for example: !pwd). You can type exit to quit Claude Code.

Shortcuts	Description
shift+tab	switch between planning and auto-accept mode
take a screenshot	cmd+ shift+ ctrl + 4 (Mac) or Win + Shift + S (Windows)
paste a screenshot	Ctrl + V (might not work on Windows)
Additional Claude Features

#### Extended Thinking Mode

For complex tasks (e.g., complex architectural changes, debugging complicated issues), you can use the word "think" to trigger [extended thinking mode](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking). There are several levels of thinking: "think" < "think hard" < "think harder" < "ultrathink." Each level allocates more thinking budget for Claude.

#### Use of subagents

You've learned that one of the out-of-the-box tools for Claude Code is Task, which Claude Code can use to launch subagents for complex multi-step tasks. You can explicitly ask Claude Code to use subagents to brainstorm ideas or to investigate multiple aspects of a question or a problem you want to solve. These built-in agents are of general purpose.

You can also create your customized specialized subagents. Each subagent has its own context window, and you can define a custom system prompt and specific tools for each subagent. This part is not covered in this course, but you can check the details in the documentation [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents).
