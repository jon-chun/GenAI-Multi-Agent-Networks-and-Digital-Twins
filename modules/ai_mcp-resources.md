# Lesson 4: Creating an MCP Server


In this lesson, you will wrap the tools of the chatbot of the previous lesson, to build an MCP server that exposes 2 tools. You will use here the `stdio` transport and run the server in the provided local environment. You will learn more about remote servers in another lesson.


## How can you create an MCP Server? - *Additional Note*


Let's take the example of a server that exposes tools. This server needs to handle two main requests from the client:
- listing all the tools
  
   <img src="images/server_list_tools.png" width="400">

- executing a particular tool
  
  <img src="images/server_call_tool.png" width="400">


There are two ways for creating an MCP server:
- **low-level implementation**: in this approach, you directly define and handle the various types of requests (`ListToolsRequest` and `CallToolRequest`). This approach allows you to customize every aspect of your server.
- **high-level implementation using `FastMCP`**: `FastMCP` is a high-level interface that makes building MCP servers faster and simpler. In this approach, you just focus on defining the tools as functions, and`FastMCP` handles all the protocol details.
  
You will use in this lesson `FastMCP`. If you'd like to learn more about the low-level approach, you can check out the resources at the end of this notebook.


## Building your MCP Server using `FastMCP`


You will build the files needed for your MCP server in the folder `mcp_project`. You will incrementally add or update more files to this project folder in the upcoming lessons. The `mcp_project` folder is provided to you. You will first create the python file of the server `research_server.py` and save it in  `mcp_project` folder, then you'll prepare the environment to run the server.

To create your MCP server using `FastMCP`, you will initialize a `FastMCP` server labeled as `mcp` and decorating the functions with `@mcp.tool()`. `FastMCP` automatically generates the necessary MCP schema based on type hints and docstrings.


**Note**: The magic function `%%writefile mcp_project/research_server.py` will not execute the code but it will save the content of the cell to the server file `research_server.py` in the directory: `mcp_project`. If you remove the magic function and run the cell, the code won't run in Jupyter notebook. You will run the server from the terminal in the next section.


```python
%%writefile mcp_project/research_server.py

import arxiv
import json
import os
from typing import List
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP


PAPER_DIR = "papers"

# Initialize FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP("research")

@mcp.tool()
def search_papers(topic: str, max_results: int = 5) -> List[str]:
    """

    """
    
    # Use arxiv to find the papers 
    client = arxiv.Client()

    # Search for the most relevant articles matching the queried topic
    search = arxiv.Search(
        query = topic,
        max_results = max_results,
        sort_by = arxiv.SortCriterion.Relevance
    )

    papers = client.results(search)

## Setting up your Environment & Testing your Server


You'll now set up the environment that you will use to run and test the server. For that, you will use the `uv` tool, which helps you manage your Python environment: it automatically sets up the project files and manages the package dependencies.


**Terminal Instructions**


- To open the terminal, run the cell below.
- Navigate to the project directory and initiate it with `uv`:
    - `cd L4/mcp_project`
    - `uv init`
-  Create virtual environment and activate it:
    - `uv venv`
    - `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies:
    - `uv add mcp arxiv`
- Launch the inspector:
    - `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run research_server.py`
    - If you get a message asking "need to install the following packages", type: `y`
- You will get a message saying that the inspector is up and running at a specific address. To open the inspector, click on that given address. The inspector will open in another tab.
- In the inspector UI, make sure to follow the video. You would need to specify under configuration the `Inspector Proxy Address`. Please check the "Inspector UI Instructions" below and run the last cell (after the terminal) to get the `Inspector Proxy Address` for your configurations. 
- If you tested the tool and would like to access the `papers` folder: 1) click on the `File` option on the top menu of the notebook and 2) click on `Open` and then 3) click on `L4` -> `mcp_project`.
- Once you're done with the inspector UI, make sure to close the inspector by typing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal below.


```python
# start a new terminal
import os
from IPython.display import IFrame

IFrame(f"{os.environ.get('DLAI_LOCAL_URL').format(port=8888)}terminals/1", 
       width=600, height=768)
```


### Inspector UI Instructions


In the inspector UI, make sure you have:

<img src="images/inspector2.png" height="300">

1.  `uv` under command
2.  `run research_server.py` under arguments
3.  Under configuration, you have to specify the "Inspector Proxy Address":
      - Run the following cell and copy the output address and paste it under "Inspector Proxy Address" in the inspector UI. **Note**: if you're running the inspector locally on your machine, you don't need to worry about this step.


```python
# Print the inspector proxy address
print("Inspector Proxy Address that you need to specify under configuration in the inspector UI:")
print(os.environ.get('DLAI_LOCAL_URL').format(port=6277)[:-1])
```

### How to replicate the work locally?

- First make sure you have `uv` installed. You can check the installation methods [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#pypi).
- Second you need to make sure you have `Node.js` installed on your machine. This is needed to run packages written in  `Typescript` (like the MCP inspector and maybe other MCP servers that you may download to use in your app). For instructions, check [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

After you have these two installed, then you can create the `mcp_project` folder and follow the same steps. If you're using a `Windows` machine, the only step you need to modify is how to activate your virtual environment. Instead of `source .venv/bin/activate`, you would need to type: `.venv\Scripts\activate` without `source`.
