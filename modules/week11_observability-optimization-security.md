# Week 11: AI Agent Obserability, Optimization, and Security

This week we'll read more indepth on LangChain, LangGraph and LangSmith. We'll also explore various ways to create multi-agent systems (MAS) and orchestrate multiple agents for coding in particular or any task in general. We'll weight the pros/cons of custom MAS vs full-featured off-the-shelf MAS like those from LangChain, CrewAI, and other leading frameworks. Finally, we'll sketch out the Mini-Project #3 in writing a formal IT Project Proposal.
