# Week 11: AI Agent Obserability, Optimization, and Security

This week readings are longer and fewer to focus the mind and bring together many of the divese streams of thought we've covered to this point from zshell config to agentic frameworks to AI research to the developing a better model of AI-driven economics and social unrest including China's growing role. Some of these topics are better addressed in class while others are optimized for long-form content like realistic long-form AI enterprise development. 

In-class, we'll tidy-up our from last class and go deeper into the LangChain, LangGraph and LangSmith eco-system reviewing lower level issues like control flow, hooks, traces, and related AI engineering issues. With this under the belt we'll proceed to carefully analyze this week's main assignment: live coding a RAG-based Personal AI Coach.

## Mini-Project #3: A real-world RAG Recommendation

* DUE by Nov 7th (This Fri): **ASSIGNED GROUP SECTION**
    - This is also a COLLABORATIVE TEAM PROJECT, part of your grade is based upon completing your group's subtask assigned in last class. 
    - Please update your groups tasks report to our [Mini-Project #3 Github](https://github.com/jon-chun/iphs391-mp3-agentic-rag-system-report) where the instructions have been updated, cleaned, and moved from our week 11 course webpage.
    - Submit your group task report in markdown (*.md), plain text (*.txt), and/or PDF (from best to worst for AI ingestion/reuse)
    -  Submissions past this date will be marked down. Your fellow classmates are relying upon you to complete this on time in order to complete their own personal CAPB Report this weekend
* DUE by Nov 12th (next class): **INDIVIDUAL CAP REPORT**
    Your INDIVIDUAL final [CAPB Report](../code/tech-reports/student_report_skeleton.md) following this [CAPB Scoring Rubric](../code/tech-reports/overview_and_rubric.md)
