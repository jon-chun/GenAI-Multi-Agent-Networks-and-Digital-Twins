# Week 13: Meta-Coding and Research

The narrative arc of our study of AI Agents is culminating with a broader perspective on the individual art of programming and organizational collaboration around professional software engineering. This week we study specific examples of how AI is redefining the entire software development lifecycle  (SDLC) and every aspect within and around it from collaborative human-AI DevOps to long-running fully autonomous AI agents tasked with non-trivial human workflows.

Finally, with the release of Google Gemini 3.0, Google Gravity IDE, Banana Pro image model, and OpenAI GPT Codex Max in the past 48 hours we are seeing step function-like jumps in AI performance. This is an apt coda to our semester at the Frontiers of AI marked by rapid and constant change.

## Mini-Project #2 Benchmark Dataset

I've coded up a new library that can analyze, identify, and rank semantically ambiguous standalone sentences. I'll run it this weekend to generate our benchmark dataset, partition it among the students in a 3-way inter-annotator scheme, and update/rewrite the labeler software for you to use to process/label your assigned benchmark examples.

Your grade on this project willprimarily be determined by (1) completeness (finish labeling your assigned data subset by next class) and (2) correctness. For correctness, I'll post-process your labeled 300 sentences with several quality metrics to ensure your labeling is within tolerance ranges.Because we have inter-annotator agreement, you will each have 300 sentences to label, which reduces each person's net contribution to 100 sentences in the benchmark dataset. I estimate this would take approximately 60 minutes net, depending upon your reading speed and concentrated flow state (e.g., 1 sentence/10 sec = 50 min total). Please focus and only label the data when you are fresh and mentally clear—careless mislabeled data will cause a lot of problems and affect your grade.Depending upon the quality of work, we have three possible outcomes: 
1. peer-reviewed publication
2. ArXiv preprint, or,
3. neither

It would be a great addition to your CV to co-author an AI paper, but this has to be a collective effort. Think of yourself as part of a research team for this class—don't let your teammates down!
