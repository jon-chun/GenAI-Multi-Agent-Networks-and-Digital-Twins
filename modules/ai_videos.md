# Extract Clips

There are several open-source and Python libraries available for extracting engaging clips from long videos, similar to tools like Opus, Klap, and Veed.io. Here are some options you can consider:

## ClipsAI

ClipsAI is an open-source Python library specifically designed for automatically converting long videos into clips[6]. It's particularly well-suited for audio-centric, narrative-based videos like podcasts, interviews, speeches, and sermons.

Key features:
- Uses video transcripts to identify and create clips
- Dynamically reframes and focuses on the current speaker
- Can convert videos into various aspect ratios

Example usage:

```python
from clipsai import ClipFinder, Transcriber

transcriber = Transcriber()
transcription = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file_path="/path/to/video.mp4")

clipfinder = ClipFinder()
clips = clipfinder.find_clips(transcription=transcription)

print("StartTime: ", clips.start_time)
print("EndTime: ", clips.end_time)
```

## MoviePy

MoviePy is a powerful Python library for video editing that can be used to extract clips from longer videos[1][2]. While it doesn't automatically detect engaging segments, it provides a flexible framework for implementing custom clip extraction logic.

Example of extracting a clip:

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip

clip = VideoFileClip("video.mp4").subclip(start_time, end_time)
clip.write_videofile("extracted_clip.mp4")
```

## OpenCV

OpenCV is a comprehensive computer vision library that can be used for video processing tasks, including frame extraction[1][2]. It can be combined with other analysis tools to identify and extract engaging clips.

Example of reading frames:

```python
import cv2

video = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mp4")
while True:
    ret, frame = video.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    # Process frame here
video.release()
```

## PyAV

PyAV is a Pythonic binding for FFmpeg libraries, offering direct access to many media processing capabilities[2]. It's suitable for projects requiring detailed control over video processing.

## YT Highlight Extractor

While not a library, YT Highlight Extractor is an open-source Python tool that extracts highlights from YouTube videos[9]. It uses an API to fetch the most replayed sections of a video and extracts them. This project could serve as a starting point or inspiration for building your own clip extraction tool.

To implement a system similar to Opus, Klap, or Veed.io, you would likely need to combine these libraries with additional analysis techniques:

1. Use speech recognition (e.g., CMU Sphinx or Google's Speech-to-Text API) to transcribe the video[9].
2. Implement sentiment analysis or keyword detection on the transcript to identify potentially engaging segments.
3. Analyze visual features using OpenCV to detect scene changes, facial expressions, or other relevant visual cues.
4. Combine these signals to score different segments of the video and extract the highest-scoring clips.

Remember that creating a fully automated system for extracting engaging clips is a complex task that often requires machine learning models trained on large datasets of human-labeled engaging content. The open-source tools mentioned here provide a foundation, but significant additional development would be needed to create a system comparable to commercial offerings.
