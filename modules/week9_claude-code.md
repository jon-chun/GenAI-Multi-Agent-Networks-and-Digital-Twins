# Week 9: Claude Code, CLI Development and SDD

Last week our regularly scheduled program was interrupted by a slew of fundamental and significant new product announcements. This week will pivot to how Anthropic's new releases of Claude Code and Skills features are fundamentally reshaping AI-assisted coding. We'll also compare, contrast, and integrate different approaches to efficient context management with various spec-driven development approaches. Equipped with these new superpowers, we will develop our Mini-Project #3 RAG and GraphRAG collective specifications and individual datasets.
