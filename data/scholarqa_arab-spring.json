      "tldr": "The Arab Spring refers to a wave of pro-democracy uprisings that swept across several Middle Eastern and North African countries beginning in late 2010, with social media playing a pivotal role in organizing and spreading information. Researchers have increasingly applied artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, particularly natural language processing (NLP), to analyze the vast amounts of data generated during these movements to understand information flows, detect misinformation, and examine sentiment patterns. (LLM Memory)",
      "text": "\nThe Arab Spring represented a series of unprecedented civil uprisings and protests that began in Tunisia in December 2010 and quickly spread to Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Syria, Bahrain, and other countries across the Middle East and North Africa. These movements were characterized by calls for democracy, human rights, economic opportunities, and an end to corruption. What made the Arab Spring particularly significant was the novel role of digital technologies, especially social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, which served as tools for organizing protests, disseminating information, and bypassing state-controlled media. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nSince these events, academic researchers have been developing increasingly sophisticated computational methods to analyze the massive datasets generated during these political movements. Natural language processing and other AI techniques have proven valuable for examining how information spread during these events, identifying propaganda campaigns, detecting misinformation, and understanding public sentiment. These technologies allow researchers to process and analyze text at scales impossible through traditional manual content analysis methods. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe term \"color revolutions\" is sometimes used to describe these movements, drawing parallels to earlier pro-democracy movements in post-Soviet states that were often associated with specific colors or symbols. However, the Arab Spring movements developed their own unique characteristics and trajectories across different countries. As of 2024, with advancements in large language models and other AI technologies, researchers have gained new tools to retrospectively analyze these complex socio-political events and their information ecosystems. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThis emerging field represents an interdisciplinary approach combining political science, communication studies, computational linguistics, and data science to understand how digital media shapes political movements and how information flows during periods of social upheaval. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

      "text": "\nSocial media platforms emerged as crucial catalysts during the Arab Spring movements, fundamentally altering how political protests were organized and information was shared. These digital tools enabled activists to bypass state-controlled media channels, create alternative information networks, and coordinate protest activities with unprecedented efficiency. As Horne et al. note, social media shifted power dynamics away from elites who traditionally controlled information flow to ordinary citizens and grassroots movements, particularly during the Arab Spring <Paper corpusId=\"267320858\" paperTitle=\"(Horne et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This democratization of information sharing represented a significant departure from previous political movements.\n\nThe impact of social media on these uprisings was multifaceted. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook contributed to awareness-raising, recruitment of participants, mobilization of protests, and sustainability of the movements in Tunisia, Egypt, and beyond <Paper corpusId=\"267618300\" paperTitle=\"(Tambari et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These digital tools amplified citizen voices and provided spaces for organizing and expressing dissent that had previously been unavailable in many of these countries <Paper corpusId=\"267954657\" paperTitle=\"(Sheikh, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The rapid dissemination of information enabled by social media transformed isolated grievances into collective calls for political reform <Paper corpusId=\"268001750\" paperTitle=\"(Kharel, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nResearch has shown that social media platforms were particularly effective at shaping political discourse around the uprisings. Howard et al. found that revolutionary conversations on social networks preceded major on-the-ground revolts in Tunisia and Egypt, helping to disseminate the democratic ideas that underpinned the revolutions <Paper corpusId=\"273248668\" paperTitle=\"(Torrecillas-Lacave et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Citizens, activists, and journalists shared real-time perspectives that often contradicted mainstream media narratives, leading to more nuanced international understanding of these complex movements <Paper corpusId=\"275966574\" paperTitle=\"(Almakaty, 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"204825789\" paperTitle=\"(Mavrodieva et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This aspect of social media as a \"soft power\" tool during the Arab Spring has continued to influence how researchers understand the relationship between digital platforms and political movements.\n\nThe Arab Spring thus represents a watershed moment in understanding how social media can facilitate collective political action, offering both historical insight and lessons for contemporary movements. These events demonstrated how digital platforms could not only connect like-minded individuals but also create sustained momentum for social and political change in environments previously dominated by tightly controlled information ecosystems.",

            "Today's media systems are hybrid. As described by Chadwick (2017): professional-driven news cycles develop along side ordinary citizens and activist on social media. It has been argued that this mixing of old and new logics has shifted power away from elites, who in the past retained authority over information flow and could steer the news agenda, to ordinary citizens and grassroots movements. For example, social media and the coverage of information conveyed on social media gave power to anti-government protesters during the Arab Spring (Khondker 2011), and more recently, during the Black Lives Matter movement, activists gained the attention of traditional news media through social media efficacy and coordination (Freelon et al., 2018)(Zhang et al., 2018)."

            "Climate change has been one of the most debated topics in the past few decades, but a number of challenges have hindered the development of robust policies and strategies by nations. At the same time, social media platforms—such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook—have given the opportunity for the general public to share opinions and engage with the issue of climate change like never before. This phenomenon is considered to be a new form of soft power which can provide input into the discussion and possibly affect the current international political mechanisms. The present paper aims to (1) define the forms and characteristics of social media as a soft power method, (2) analyze its influence on the awareness of societies, and (3) assess if increased public awareness could influence the official political and policy processes. In order to assess if social media has influence on people’s relative awareness, we have focused on analyzing the links between a few highly visible climate change related events and the trends in people’s searches on the Internet in connection to those events. The study finds that even though it is difficult to assess the effects of social media as a soft power tool with certainty, there are visible links between social media and changing public perceptions, with the possibility of public opinion influencing political decision-making."

            "In the evolving landscape of political forecasting, traditional methods such as opinion polls and voter surveys are often limited by sample size, time delays, and response biases (Ansu-Kyeremeh, 1999). With the rapid digitalization of news and the proliferation of online media, public sentiment, as reflected in news articles, has emerged as a valuable indicator of political climate [2]. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly sentiment analysis, offers a modern approach to gauge public opinion through media coverage. Sentiment analysis classifies text into sentiments-positive, negative, or neutral-allowing researchers to discern the tone of media articles discussing political candidates and key issues [3]. This technology has been applied to various domains, including marketing, finance, and politics, providing a predictive edge in decisionmaking processes (Lotfi et al., 2021). Recent elections in several democratic countries have witnessed increasing interest in using AIdriven sentiment analysis for election forecasting [5]. In contrast to traditional polling, which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in certain contexts, AI-based sentiment analysis leverages publicly available data, such as news articles and social media posts, to create a real-time understanding of political sentiment (Jaidka et al., 2019). By processing and analyzing large volumes of text, AI can extract patterns of support, opposition, or neutrality toward political candidates and parties. These patterns can then be used to predict election outcomes, making sentiment analysis a promising tool for political forecasters, especially in regions with limited or unreliable polling data [7]."

            "ABSTRACT This study introduces and evaluates the robustness of different volumetric, sentiment, and social network approaches to predict the elections in three Asian countries – Malaysia, India, and Pakistan from Twitter posts. We find that predictive power of social media performs well for India and Pakistan but is not effective for Malaysia. Overall, we find that it is useful to consider the recency of Twitter posts while using it to predict a real outcome, such as an election result. Sentiment information mined using machine learning models was the most accurate predictor of election outcomes. Social network information is stable despite sudden surges in political discussions, for e.g. around elections-related news events. Methods combining sentiment and volume information, or sentiment and social network information, are effective at predicting smaller vote shares, for e.g. vote shares in the case of independent candidates and regional parties. We conclude with a detailed discussion on the caveats of social media analysis for predicting real-world outcomes and recommendations for future work."

Instead of using count-based traditional sentiment index methods, the study uses its own sum and relevance based sentiment index mechanism. Hourly price data has been used in this research as daily data is too late and minutes data is too early for getting the exclusive effect of sentiments. Normally, hourly data is extremely costly and difficult to manage and analyze. Hourly data has been rarely used in similar kinds of researches. To built sentiment index, text analytic information has been parsed and analyzed, textual information that is relevant to selected stocks has been collected, aggregated, categorized, and refined with NLP and eventually converted scientifically into hourly sentiment index. News analytic sources include mainstream media, print media, social media, news feeds, blogs, investors’ advisory portals, experts’ opinions, brokers updates, web-based information, company’ internal news and public announcements regarding policies and reforms. The results of the study indicate that sentiments significantly influence the direction of stocks, on average after 3–4 h. Top ten companies from High-tech, financial, medical, automobile sectors are selected, and six LSTM models, three for using text-analytic and other without analytic are used. Every model includes 1, 3, and 6 h steps back. For all sectors, a 6-hour steps based model outperforms the other models due to LSTM specialty of keeping long term memory. Collective accuracy of textual analytic models is way higher relative to non-textual analytic models."

This research addresses unique challenges in Arabic content analysis, where the language's complexity creates additional obstacles for detection systems. The Arabic language presents several distinct challenges for propaganda and misinformation detection, including its rich vocabulary and the presence of various dialects used across different Arab countries and regions. Social media users typically communicate using both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the formal language, and Dialectal Arabic (DA), the informal language used in daily communication, with the latter being more common online <Paper corpusId=\"267503979\" paperTitle=\"(Alotaibi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"157063678\" paperTitle=\"(AL-Saif et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe aftermath of the Arab Spring and Syrian crisis saw a significant increase in rumors and false information circulating online, highlighting the need for robust detection systems <Paper corpusId=\"267503979\" paperTitle=\"(Alotaibi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26631757\" paperTitle=\"(Zaatari et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. To address this challenge, researchers have developed specialized Arabic corpora for credibility classification, recognizing the lack of such resources despite the growing popularity of blogs and microblogs in the Arab world <Paper corpusId=\"267503979\" paperTitle=\"(Alotaibi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26631757\" paperTitle=\"(Zaatari et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. These efforts aim to filter out non-credible information using machine learning approaches that require sufficiently large and accurate training data.\n\nRecent advances in propaganda detection for Arabic content include the development of optimized systems leveraging transformer-based language models such as AraBERT with neural network classifiers for sequence tagging <Paper corpusId=\"270870581\" paperTitle=\"(Abir et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Researchers have proposed robust preprocessing pipelines specifically for Arabic, addressing unique challenges such as Unicode inconsistencies, misaligned annotations, and user-mention normalization. These pipelines aim to improve the detection of propagandistic techniques in Arabic texts, which is crucial for maintaining information integrity <Paper corpusId=\"270870581\" paperTitle=\"(Abir et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe detection of political bias in social media content has also received attention, with researchers identifying bias in user-generated content and surveying sentiment analysis techniques <Paper corpusId=\"271432238\" paperTitle=\"(Zaghouani et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have advanced beyond examining lexical bias (captured by linguistic attributes like word choice and syntax) to address informational bias—factual content that can nevertheless be deployed to sway reader opinion <Paper corpusId=\"271432238\" paperTitle=\"(Zaghouani et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"202537179\" paperTitle=\"(Fan et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This distinction is particularly important in the context of the Arab Spring, where the credibility of information shared on social media platforms significantly influenced public perception and participation in political movements.\n\nSeveral initiatives have specifically focused on Arabic propaganda detection, addressing the language gap in research that previously concentrated primarily on English content. The WANLP 2022 workshop, for instance, organized a shared task for detecting propaganda techniques in Arabic tweets through multilabel classification, attracting 63 participating teams <Paper corpusId=\"271769411\" paperTitle=\"(Haouhat et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"253708388\" paperTitle=\"(Alam et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

            "Rumors and false information have also proliferated in politics, as was the case during the Arab Spring and the Syrian crisis (Zaatari et al., 2016). The Arabic language is considered one of the most commonly spoken languages in the world, and an essential language for Muslims worldwide, who numbered about 1.8 billion in 2015 and are expected to increase to three billion in 2060, according to the Pew Research Center [8]. The Arabic language presents various challenges. First, there are different dialects used in different Arab countries, as well as from regions in the same country. The language also has a rich vocabulary that leads to the occurrence of misleading information from different dialects, making it more difficult for the system to detect (Alqurashi et al., 2021). In social media, the complexity of understanding the Arabic language is increased because users on social media, such as Twitter, use two forms of the language: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the formal language, and Dialect Arabic (DA), which is informal, used in daily communication between users, and is more common than MSA (AL-Saif et al., 2019)."

            "With the current increase in the number of online users, there has been a concomitant increase in the amount of data shared online. Techniques for discovering knowledge from these data can provide us with valuable information when it comes to detecting different problems, including violence. Violence is one of the significant problems humanity has faced in recent years all over the world, and this is especially a problem in Arabic countries. To address this issue, this research focuses on detecting violence-related tweets to help in solving this problem. Text mining is an important technique that can be used to find and predict information from text. In this study, a text classification model is built for detecting violence in Arabic dialects on Twitter using different feature-reduction approaches. The experiment comprises bagging, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Bayesian boosting using different extraction features, namely, root-based stemming, light stemming, and n-grams. In addition, the study used the following feature-reduction techniques: support vector machine (SVM), Chi-squared (CHI), the Gini index, correlation, rules, information gain (IG), deviation, symmetrical uncertainty, and the IG ratio. The experiment showed that the bagging with tri-gram approach has the highest accuracy at 86.61%, and a combination of IG with SVM from reduction features registers an accuracy of 90.59%."

            "The increasing prevalence of political bias in news media calls for greater public awareness of it, as well as robust methods for its detection. While prior work in NLP has primarily focused on the lexical bias captured by linguistic attributes such as word choice and syntax, other types of bias stem from the actual content selected for inclusion in the text. In this work, we investigate the effects of informational bias: factual content that can nevertheless be deployed to sway reader opinion. We first produce a new dataset, BASIL, of 300 news articles annotated with 1,727 bias spans and find evidence that informational bias appears in news articles more frequently than lexical bias. We further study our annotations to observe how informational bias surfaces in news articles by different media outlets. Lastly, a baseline model for informational bias prediction is presented by fine-tuning BERT on our labeled data, indicating the challenges of the task and future directions."

However, only 2100 labeled propagandist tweets covering banking and sports are included in the dataset, and the unlabeled tweets are limited to Saudi Arabian Twitter data, necessitating generalization to diverse topics and regions within the Arab world. Despite these limitations, the dataset offers valuable insights into Arab computational propaganda and enables supervised and unsupervised machine learning and deep learning algorithm applications to classify the credibility of Arab tweets.

            "Propaganda is defined as an expression of opinion or action by individuals or groups deliberately designed to influence opinions or actions of other individuals or groups with reference to predetermined ends and this is achieved by means of well-defined rhetorical and psychological devices. Currently, propaganda (or persuasion) techniques have been commonly used on social media to manipulate or mislead social media users. Automatic detection of propaganda techniques from textual, visual, or multimodal content has been studied recently, however, major of such efforts are focused on English language content. In this paper, we propose a shared task on detecting propaganda techniques for Arabic textual content. We have done a pilot annotation of 200 Arabic tweets, which we plan to extend to 2,000 tweets, covering diverse topics. We hope that the shared task will help in building a community for Arabic propaganda detection. The dataset will be made publicly available, which can help in future studies."

            "The ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis has been a subject to traditional media bias and propaganda for years, layers over layers of misinformation accumulated over decades did not help bridge the gap between Palestinian and Israeli public points of views. Then comes the event of October 7 th , coinciding with the era of Social Media, where people can see and hear the suffering of innocent war victims through numerous social platforms, alternative to traditional media outlets. One would think that in the age of information, controlling a narrative would be out of the reach, however since the events of 7 th of October and followed by Israel's military response, social media has been plagued with bias and propaganda, and the same narratives and talking points from media, globally, are echoing all over social networks. Detecting bias and propaganda from news or social media posts has been deeply explored in the literature and a variety of methodologies and techniques have been presented. For instance, detecting bias through sentiment analysis on news reports using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques (Park et al., 2009). Hutto et. al. presented sentiment analysis, subjectivity analysis, modality and other analysis to detect bias in short sentences (Hutto et al., 2015). Shahi et. al. has presented a semi-automatic annotation framework to detect misinformation on COVID-19 pandemic in social media posts (Shahi, 2022). Abuaiadah et. al. performed Clustering on Arabic Tweets in order to detect sentiment (D. (Abuaiadah et al., 2017)."

Previous work has addressed propaganda detection at document level, typically labelling all articles from a propagandistic news outlet as propaganda. Such noisy gold labels inevitably affect the quality of any learning system trained on them. A further issue with most existing systems is the lack of explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel task: performing fine-grained analysis of texts by detecting all fragments that contain propaganda techniques as well as their type. In particular, we create a corpus of news articles manually annotated at fragment level with eighteen propaganda techniques and propose a suitable evaluation measure. We further design a novel multi-granularity neural network, and we show that it outperforms several strong BERT-based baselines."

Traditional methods of gauging public sentiment, such as opinion polls and voter surveys, often suffer from limitations including small sample sizes, time delays, and response biases. The digitalization of news and the proliferation of online media have created opportunities to analyze public sentiment through media coverage using AI and NLP techniques <Paper corpusId=\"273654880\" paperTitle=\"(Chercheur et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

            "In the evolving landscape of political forecasting, traditional methods such as opinion polls and voter surveys are often limited by sample size, time delays, and response biases (Ansu-Kyeremeh, 1999). With the rapid digitalization of news and the proliferation of online media, public sentiment, as reflected in news articles, has emerged as a valuable indicator of political climate [2]. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly sentiment analysis, offers a modern approach to gauge public opinion through media coverage. Sentiment analysis classifies text into sentiments-positive, negative, or neutral-allowing researchers to discern the tone of media articles discussing political candidates and key issues [3]. This technology has been applied to various domains, including marketing, finance, and politics, providing a predictive edge in decisionmaking processes (Lotfi et al., 2021). Recent elections in several democratic countries have witnessed increasing interest in using AIdriven sentiment analysis for election forecasting [5]. In contrast to traditional polling, which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in certain contexts, AI-based sentiment analysis leverages publicly available data, such as news articles and social media posts, to create a real-time understanding of political sentiment (Jaidka et al., 2019). By processing and analyzing large volumes of text, AI can extract patterns of support, opposition, or neutrality toward political candidates and parties. These patterns can then be used to predict election outcomes, making sentiment analysis a promising tool for political forecasters, especially in regions with limited or unreliable polling data [7]."

            "ABSTRACT This study introduces and evaluates the robustness of different volumetric, sentiment, and social network approaches to predict the elections in three Asian countries – Malaysia, India, and Pakistan from Twitter posts. We find that predictive power of social media performs well for India and Pakistan but is not effective for Malaysia. Overall, we find that it is useful to consider the recency of Twitter posts while using it to predict a real outcome, such as an election result. Sentiment information mined using machine learning models was the most accurate predictor of election outcomes. Social network information is stable despite sudden surges in political discussions, for e.g. around elections-related news events. Methods combining sentiment and volume information, or sentiment and social network information, are effective at predicting smaller vote shares, for e.g. vote shares in the case of independent candidates and regional parties. We conclude with a detailed discussion on the caveats of social media analysis for predicting real-world outcomes and recommendations for future work."

            "In recent years, groups of cyber criminals/hackers have carried out cyber-attacks using various tactics with the goal of destabilizing web services in a specific context for which they are motivated. Predicting these attacks is a critical task that assists in determining what actions should be taken to mitigate the effects of such attacks and to prevent them in the future. Although there are programs to detect security concerns on the internet, there is currently no system that can anticipate or foretell whether the attacks will be successful. This research aims to develop sustainable strategies to reduce threats, vulnerability, and data manipulation of chatbots, consequently improving cyber security. To achieve this goal, we develop a conversational chatbot, an application that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to communicate, and deploy it on social media sites (e.g., Twitter) for cyber security purposes. Chatbots have the capacity to consume large amounts of information and give an appropriate response in an efficient and timely manner, thus rendering them useful in predicting threats emanating from social media. The research utilizes sentiment analysis strategy by employing chatbots on Twitter (and analyzing Twitter data) for predicting future threats and cyber-attacks. The strategy is based on a daily collection of tweets from two types of users: those who use the platform to voice their opinions on important and relevant subjects, and those who use it to share information on cyber security attacks. The research provides tools and strategies for developing chatbots that can be used for assessing cyber threats on social media through sentiment analysis leading to a global sustainable development of businesses. Future research may utilize and improvise on the tools and strategies suggested in our research to strengthen the knowledge domain of chatbots, cyber security, and social media."

            "ABSTRACT This work is based on a mixe between the dynamics of investor decision making and the effectiveness of the forecasting models used to model market movements. Thus, it appears that the determination of adequate models can help to explain the behavior of agents and result to easier decision making through the anticipation of future prices. For this reason, we will use artificial intelligence models, in particular Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, in order to better understand the variation of asset prices and their future evolution. In order to do so, we will use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which has proven to be very suitable in the case of the Moroccan banking sector. The comparison between classical models and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has demonstrated the inadequacy of classical statistical models. The latter are based on certain assumptions not verified in the framework of financial series, which reduces the capacity of classical models to correctly predict new data. The integration of AI has also made it possible to overcome the assumption of market efficiency by modeling the behavior of irrational agents, who trade on rumors and false news."

      "tldr": "Arabic natural language processing faces unique challenges due to the language's rich morphology, diverse dialects, and the coexistence of formal Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and informal Dialectal Arabic (DA) in social media communications. These linguistic complexities create significant obstacles for developing effective NLP tools to analyze the Arab Spring and related events, particularly in tasks like propaganda detection, misinformation identification, and sentiment analysis. (9 sources)",
      "text": "\nArabic presents distinctive challenges for natural language processing researchers studying content related to the Arab Spring and subsequent political movements. The language's complexity is multifaceted, beginning with its rich vocabulary and morphological structure that complicate automated text analysis <Paper corpusId=\"267503979\" paperTitle=\"(Alotaibi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Perhaps most significantly, Arabic exists in multiple forms used across different contexts: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which serves as the formal language, and Dialectal Arabic (DA), which represents the informal language used in everyday communication. On social media platforms—critical sources for Arab Spring research—users typically employ both forms, with the informal DA being more prevalent than MSA <Paper corpusId=\"267503979\" paperTitle=\"(Alotaibi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"157063678\" paperTitle=\"(AL-Saif et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe dialectal variation within Arabic presents a substantial obstacle for NLP systems. Different dialects are used across Arab countries and even across regions within the same country, creating significant linguistic diversity <Paper corpusId=\"267503979\" paperTitle=\"(Alotaibi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This variation can lead to misleading information as systems struggle to account for dialectal differences in vocabulary, syntax, and semantics <Paper corpusId=\"267503979\" paperTitle=\"(Alotaibi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"231603127\" paperTitle=\"(Alqurashi et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. For research analyzing Arab Spring content, these dialectal variations pose a particular challenge as they can confound systems attempting to detect subtle propagandistic messaging or misinformation.\n\nThe aftermath of the Arab Spring and Syrian crisis saw a proliferation of rumors and false information online, highlighting the urgent need for credibility classification systems specifically designed for Arabic content <Paper corpusId=\"267503979\" paperTitle=\"(Alotaibi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26631757\" paperTitle=\"(Zaatari et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. While effective machine learning approaches require large, accurate training datasets, there has been a notable lack of public Arabic corpora for tasks like credibility classification, despite the growing popularity of blogs and microblogs in the Arab world <Paper corpusId=\"267503979\" paperTitle=\"(Alotaibi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26631757\" paperTitle=\"(Zaatari et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This data scarcity represents a significant challenge for research in this domain.\n\nIn the specific area of propaganda detection, researchers face additional challenges when working with Arabic content. While propaganda detection has received considerable attention for English language content, Arabic has historically received less focus despite its importance <Paper corpusId=\"271769411\" paperTitle=\"(Haouhat et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"253708388\" paperTitle=\"(Alam et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Efforts to bridge this language gap include the creation of specialized datasets, such as one containing 16 million Arabic tweets with a subset labeled for propaganda <Paper corpusId=\"271769411\" paperTitle=\"(Haouhat et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, existing datasets often have limitations in terms of topic coverage or regional focus, necessitating generalization to diverse topics and regions across the Arab world <Paper corpusId=\"271769411\" paperTitle=\"(Haouhat et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe increasing reliance on social media for news consumption among Arab youth—with approximately 79% obtaining news from social media—underscores the importance of focusing on Arabic content for fake news detection <Paper corpusId=\"273743203\" paperTitle=\"(Mostafa et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The unique linguistic and cultural nuances inherent in Arabic social media content require specialized approaches for effective analysis <Paper corpusId=\"273743203\" paperTitle=\"(Mostafa et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. While substantial research has focused on machine learning methodologies for fake news detection on social media platforms, many studies primarily address English datasets, creating a research gap for Arabic content <Paper corpusId=\"273743203\" paperTitle=\"(Mostafa et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"234785728\" paperTitle=\"(Al-Yahya et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246780500\" paperTitle=\"(Himdi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent efforts have attempted to address these challenges by developing Arabic natural language processing tools specifically designed for tasks like fake news detection and textual feature extraction <Paper corpusId=\"246780500\" paperTitle=\"(Himdi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, researchers have explored the use of transformer-based language models for Arabic fake news detection, demonstrating performance improvements compared to neural network-based solutions <Paper corpusId=\"234785728\" paperTitle=\"(Al-Yahya et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

            "Rumors and false information have also proliferated in politics, as was the case during the Arab Spring and the Syrian crisis (Zaatari et al., 2016). The Arabic language is considered one of the most commonly spoken languages in the world, and an essential language for Muslims worldwide, who numbered about 1.8 billion in 2015 and are expected to increase to three billion in 2060, according to the Pew Research Center [8]. The Arabic language presents various challenges. First, there are different dialects used in different Arab countries, as well as from regions in the same country. The language also has a rich vocabulary that leads to the occurrence of misleading information from different dialects, making it more difficult for the system to detect (Alqurashi et al., 2021). In social media, the complexity of understanding the Arabic language is increased because users on social media, such as Twitter, use two forms of the language: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the formal language, and Dialect Arabic (DA), which is informal, used in daily communication between users, and is more common than MSA (AL-Saif et al., 2019)."

            "With the current increase in the number of online users, there has been a concomitant increase in the amount of data shared online. Techniques for discovering knowledge from these data can provide us with valuable information when it comes to detecting different problems, including violence. Violence is one of the significant problems humanity has faced in recent years all over the world, and this is especially a problem in Arabic countries. To address this issue, this research focuses on detecting violence-related tweets to help in solving this problem. Text mining is an important technique that can be used to find and predict information from text. In this study, a text classification model is built for detecting violence in Arabic dialects on Twitter using different feature-reduction approaches. The experiment comprises bagging, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Bayesian boosting using different extraction features, namely, root-based stemming, light stemming, and n-grams. In addition, the study used the following feature-reduction techniques: support vector machine (SVM), Chi-squared (CHI), the Gini index, correlation, rules, information gain (IG), deviation, symmetrical uncertainty, and the IG ratio. The experiment showed that the bagging with tri-gram approach has the highest accuracy at 86.61%, and a combination of IG with SVM from reduction features registers an accuracy of 90.59%."

            "(Almotairy et al., 2024) tackle the challenge of detecting and characterizing Arab computational propaganda on Twitter by providing a dataset that includes 16 million tweets. However, only 2100 labeled propagandist tweets covering banking and sports are included in the dataset, and the unlabeled tweets are limited to Saudi Arabian Twitter data, necessitating generalization to diverse topics and regions within the Arab world. Despite these limitations, the dataset offers valuable insights into Arab computational propaganda and enables supervised and unsupervised machine learning and deep learning algorithm applications to classify the credibility of Arab tweets. Firoj et al. (Alam et al., 2022) highlight the importance of bridging the language gap in pro-4 https://arabicnlp2024.sigarab.org/ paganda detection by focusing on Arabic, which previously received less attention. The authors organized a shared task conducted as part of the WANLP 2022 workshop, aiming to detect propaganda techniques in Arabic tweets through multilabel classification. The task attracted significant participation, with 63 teams. Firoj et al. (Hasanain et al., 2023a) focus on the critical problem of identifying and labeling propagandistic spans within the textual content. The authors explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to function as both general and expert annotators for this task."

            "Propaganda is defined as an expression of opinion or action by individuals or groups deliberately designed to influence opinions or actions of other individuals or groups with reference to predetermined ends and this is achieved by means of well-defined rhetorical and psychological devices. Currently, propaganda (or persuasion) techniques have been commonly used on social media to manipulate or mislead social media users. Automatic detection of propaganda techniques from textual, visual, or multimodal content has been studied recently, however, major of such efforts are focused on English language content. In this paper, we propose a shared task on detecting propaganda techniques for Arabic textual content. We have done a pilot annotation of 200 Arabic tweets, which we plan to extend to 2,000 tweets, covering diverse topics. We hope that the shared task will help in building a community for Arabic propaganda detection. The dataset will be made publicly available, which can help in future studies."

The findings of this study promises great results and outperformed human performance in the same task."

            "The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms poses significant challenges to society and individuals, leading to negative impacts. As the tactics employed by purveyors of fake news continue to evolve, there is an urgent need for automatic fake news detection (FND) to mitigate its adverse social consequences. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as promising approaches for characterising and identifying fake news content. This paper presents an extensive review of previous studies aiming to understand and combat the dissemination of fake news. The review begins by exploring the definitions of fake news proposed in the literature and delves into related terms and psychological and scientific theories that shed light on why people believe and disseminate fake news. Subsequently, advanced ML and DL techniques for FND are dicussed in detail, focusing on three main feature categories: content-based, context-based, and hybrid-based features. Additionally, the review summarises the characteristics of fake news, commonly used datasets, and the methodologies employed in existing studies. Furthermore, the review identifies the challenges current FND studies encounter and highlights areas that require further investigation in future research. By offering a comprehensive overview of the field, this survey aims to serve as a guide for researchers working on FND, providing valuable insights for developing effective FND mechanisms in the era of technological advancements."
