I was approached by some of my uncles at Almost Friday, they told me they’d like me to promote their new card game. I asked, “What’s in it for me?”

A man in a mask put a briefcase in front of me and opened it. “There’s 1 trillion dollars inside.”

I laughed, “Ok, that’s just enough for me to consider it. What’s the catch? What if I don’t promote your card game?”

A 6’8” man lifted his shirt to show a holstered gun. He then threw me a picture, in it was my landlord and his family. “You know what we would do.”

“Alright, alright, I’ll do it. Just leave him and his family alone. You have NO idea the struggles he’s been through.”

They walked away into a very smokey forest, leaving the briefcase. I stood there, fully erect.
