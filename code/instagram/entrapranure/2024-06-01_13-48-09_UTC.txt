my landlord has had an incredibly difficult year. rates are high so he couldn’t afford his own home. after 3 months of being homeless I took him in. I’ve been letting him live in my 6th bedroom free of charge. I normally leave $100 bills under his pillow to know someone is watching over him. celebrate all landlords🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
