Below is a concise critique and refinement of your revised prompt, followed by a polished “ready‑to‑use” version.  
*(Skip to **Section 5** if you just want the final text.)*

## 1  Key Strengths of Your Revision
- **Focused scope** – You clearly enumerate the disciplinary lenses and practical contexts, which guides the search space.  
- **Actionable deliverables** – Explicitly requesting peer‑reviewed studies, white‑papers, and policy documents within 2020‑2025 keeps the output targeted and current.  
- **Logical structure** – The sequence (model → discipline → practical elements) mirrors how auditors actually work, making the prompt intuitive.  
- **Research‑gap flag** – Asking for gaps encourages a critical, not just descriptive, review.

## 2  Minor Edits & Clarifications
| Issue | Why It Matters | Quick Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Duplicate numbering (two “4.” items)** | May cause confusion for LLMs that rely on ordinal cues. | Renumber sequentially. |
| **“Case studies (e.g., audits of GPT‑6, Claude 4…)”** | GPT‑6 & Claude 4 are hypothetical as of Apr 2025. | Specify “latest publicly documented audits (e.g., GPT‑4o, Claude 3 Opus)”. |
| **“Medical & Behavioral Economics”** | Reads like two unrelated areas. | Split into separate bullets or clarify the joint focus on *health‑related nudging & diagnostics*. |
| **“Cross‑domain applications … finance, education, criminal justice”** | Good, but add at least one *non‑Western* jurisdiction (e.g., “micro‑finance in sub‑Saharan Africa”). | Append an extra example or say “global sectors incl. …”. |
| **“Other generative systems”** | Might lead the model to wander into music, images, etc. | Add qualifier “text‑, code‑, and vision‑aligned” if you want to exclude audio/music. |

## 3  Optional Enhancements
1. **Deliverable formatting** – Ask for a two‑level bibliography:  
   - **Summary table** (framework | year | focus | key finding | citation)  
   - **Narrative synthesis** (≈2 000 words)  
2. **Comparative lens** – Include “contrast voluntary vs. mandatory audit regimes (e.g., EU AI Act vs. U.S. voluntary NIST RMF)”.  
3. **Computational vs. human‑in‑the‑loop** – You already flagged this as optional; consider promoting it to the core request if depth matters.  
4. **Source quality filter** – Instruct the model to drop paywalled grey literature unless an open preprint exists.  
5. **Citation style** – Specify “use Chicago author‑date” (or IEEE, etc.) to enforce consistency.

## 4  Implementation Guidance for the LLM
- **Step‑wise answering**: tell the model to first gather sources, then cluster them by theme, then write the synthesis.  
- **Token budgeting**: if using GPT‑4o, limit each subsection to ≤300 words to avoid truncation.  
- **Hallucination check**: prompt the model to list all DOIs/URLs at the end so you can spot non‑existent references quickly.

## 5  Refined Prompt (drop‑in ready)

> **Task (dated 22 Apr 2025):**  
> Conduct a comprehensive literature review on **ethical auditing methodologies for AI models**—including LLMs, LMMs, and other *text‑, code‑, and vision‑oriented* generative systems—covering publications from **2020 to 2025**.
>
> ### Disciplinary Lenses  
> 1. **AI Safety & Alignment** – robustness, bias, interpretability, adversarial testing  
> 2. **Philosophy & Ethics** – moral agency, responsibility frameworks  
> 3. **Critical Decision‑Making** – high‑stakes deployments in policy and healthcare  
> 4. **Legal & Regulatory Compliance** – GDPR, EU AI Act, U.S. liability doctrines  
> 5. **Medical & Behavioral Economics** – fairness in diagnostics, algorithmic nudging
>
> ### Deliverables  
> **A. Summary Table** (framework / year / focus / key finding / citation)  
> **B. Narrative Synthesis** (~2 000 words) that covers:  
> - **Key Frameworks** (e.g., ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, OECD Trustworthy AI)  
> - **Documented Case Studies** (e.g., audits of GPT‑4o, Claude 3 Opus, domain‑specific models in radiology or fintech)  
> - **Emerging Challenges** (e.g., adversarial red‑teaming, emergent misalignment)  
> - **Cross‑Domain Applications** (finance, education, criminal justice, micro‑finance)  
> - **Identified Research Gaps** and recommended future work
>
> ### Method  
> 1. **Source Collection** – prioritize peer‑reviewed journals, conference proceedings, industry white‑papers, and policy documents; discard duplicates and paywalled grey literature unless a preprint exists.  
> 2. **Computational vs. Human‑in‑the‑Loop Techniques** – compare automated audits with participatory or socio‑technical approaches.  
> 3. **Regional Comparison** – contrast EU, U.S., and Chinese audit regimes.  
> 4. **Citation Style** – Chicago author‑date; list DOIs/URLs for verification.
>
> *Output only after reasoning through these steps; include all citations at the end.*
