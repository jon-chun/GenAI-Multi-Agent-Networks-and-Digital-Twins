This project focuses on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand and reconstruct damaged historical documents. The LLM track addresses linguistic challenges in historical dialects, while the VLM track tackles visual and structural issues in document images. Key methodologies include synthetic data generation for both linguistic and visual challenges, instruction tuning for LLMs, and integrated approaches combining OCR with LLMs for comprehensive document restoration.

# Fine-Tuning LLMs and VLMs for Understanding and Reconstructing Damaged Historical Documents

## 1. Core Challenges in Historical Document Processing
### 1.1 Linguistic Challenges in Historical Dialects (LLM Track)
The Language Model (LLM) track encounters significant hurdles due to the unique linguistic characteristics of historical dialects. **A primary challenge is the prevalence of inconsistent spelling and the use of obsolete words** no longer present in modern lexicons . Historical texts often predate standardized orthography, leading to considerable variation in word spellings, even within the same document. This variability can confuse standard language models typically trained on contemporary, standardized text. Furthermore, historical documents frequently contain words that have fallen out of use or whose meanings have shifted, creating semantic gaps that hinder accurate interpretation. **Another major difficulty lies in handling non-modern grammar and archaic syntax**, which differ substantially from contemporary language structures . These variations can include different verb conjugations, noun declensions, pronoun usage, sentence word order, and the use of particles or constructions that are no longer common. An LLM not attuned to these features may struggle to parse sentences correctly, leading to misinterpretations or an inability to generate text that authentically reflects the historical dialect. The inherent noise in historical texts, ranging from minimal to extreme, with diverse forms of noise not extensively encountered during typical LLM training, further complicates the task of post-correction and understanding .

### 1.2 Visual and Structural Challenges in Historical Documents (VLM Track)
The processing of historical documents through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems is fraught with **visual and structural challenges that significantly impede accurate text extraction and subsequent analysis**. These documents often exhibit a range of degradations due to aging, improper storage, and the inherent characteristics of historical printing and writing materials. Common issues include **faded text**, where ink has lost opacity over time; **ink bleed-through**, where text from the reverse side of a page seeps through, creating confusing patterns; and **stains** from water, mold, or other environmental factors that obscure characters . Furthermore, historical documents may feature **unusual or archaic fonts** not well-represented in standard OCR training data, leading to high error rates . The physical condition, including tears, creases, and missing portions, further complicates text line and character segmentation. These visual artifacts collectively reduce OCR accuracy, rendering off-the-shelf solutions inadequate. For instance, tests on severely damaged archival documents have shown that even advanced OCR tools like Gemini and Google Lens can exhibit **character error rates (CER) between 23-25% and word error rates (WER) exceeding 50%** .

The **structural complexities of historical documents add another layer of difficulty**. Unlike modern documents with consistent layouts, historical documents can feature **irregular column structures, varying line spacing, and the presence of marginalia or illustrations** interspersed with text . These elements can confuse OCR engines, which may struggle to identify correct reading order or differentiate main text from ancillary content. The quality of digitization itself can also introduce problems; suboptimal scanning conditions can exacerbate existing visual degradations. The combination of these factors means that OCR systems designed for clean, contemporary documents often perform poorly on historical collections, necessitating specialized approaches for preprocessing, segmentation, and recognition tailored to these unique characteristics . Addressing these multifaceted visual and structural challenges is crucial for unlocking the information within historical documents.

## 2. Vision-Language Model (VLM) Track: OCR/OMR and Image Restoration
### 2.1 Handling Degraded Image Quality and Outdated Fonts
A significant challenge in applying OCR to historical documents is the pervasive issue of **degraded image quality coupled with the use of outdated or unconventional fonts**. Historical documents often suffer from physical deteriorations such as faded ink, stains, ink bleed-through, and physical damage like tears or creases, which severely obscure character shapes . For example, faded ink can cause characters to appear broken, while ink bleed-through can introduce extraneous strokes misinterpreted as legitimate characters. Standard OCR engines, typically trained on modern, clean text using contemporary fonts, struggle to correctly identify historical typographies, leading to **high character error rates (CER) and word error rates (WER)** . Experiments have shown CERs of 23-25% and WERs over 50% on severely degraded archival documents with even advanced OCR solutions .

To address these challenges, **advanced techniques involving synthetic data generation are being developed** . This process typically involves rendering clean text using a diverse collection of historical or historically-inspired fonts and then systematically applying degradation operations to simulate real-world aging and damage. These operations can include adding random noise, resolution reduction, Gaussian blur, overlaying artifacts like stains or scratches, and simulating ink bleed-through or faded text . The **PreP-OCR pipeline**, for instance, uses **1,060 different fonts** and introduces randomized typographic perturbations like character-level spatial offsets, rotational distortions, and adaptive ink spread/erosion effects . Morphological operations like erosion and dilation can also be applied; erosion can mitigate ink bleed-through by thinning characters, while dilation can fill small gaps in faded text . By training OCR models, such as TrOCR, on these synthetically generated datasets, their performance on actual degraded historical documents can be significantly improved . The Rényi AI group's Document Image Enhancement (DIE) solution also focuses on tackling these specific issues to boost text recognition accuracy .

### 2.2 Addressing Inconsistent Line Visibility and Layout Issues
**Inconsistent line visibility and complex, often non-standard, page layouts pose significant challenges for the VLM track** when processing historical documents. Faded ink, stains, physical damage, and bleed-through can cause text lines to appear broken, partially obscured, or merged with background noise, complicating accurate line segmentation . Historical documents frequently deviate from modern typographic conventions, featuring **irregular line spacing, varying character sizes, skewed text orientations, and complex multi-column layouts**. Marginalia, annotations, and stamps can further interrupt text flow and be misinterpreted as primary content. The **PreP-OCR pipeline addresses some layout irregularities by incorporating diverse typographic variations**, including random indentation, character shifts, rotation, and bending, into its synthetic data generation process . This helps subsequent models become robust to such irregularities. Morphological operations, such as dilation, can connect broken parts of characters or lines, while erosion can help separate lines merged due to ink spread . **Skew correction is another crucial preprocessing step** to align text lines horizontally, which is vital for Tesseract's line segmentation and overall OCR quality . For more severe fragmentation, advanced techniques like connected component analysis or deep learning-based line detection models may be necessary to reliably segment text lines and regions before OCR.

### 2.3 Managing Non-Textual Elements (Illustrations, Marginalia)
Historical documents are often rich with **non-textual elements such as illustrations, diagrams, marginalia (handwritten notes in the margins), stamps, and seals**, which present unique challenges for automated processing systems. These elements are integral to the document's historical context and meaning but can interfere with standard OCR and layout analysis if not properly handled. **OCR engines may mistakenly attempt to "read" illustrations as text**, or **marginalia can be incorrectly integrated into the main body text**, disrupting the logical flow and structure of the transcribed content. Effective management of these non-textual elements requires sophisticated layout analysis techniques capable of distinguishing between different content types. This often involves training models to recognize and segment various page regions, classifying them as text blocks, images, or annotations. For VLMs, this means developing capabilities beyond simple text recognition to understand the spatial relationships and potential semantic connections between text and these visual elements. For instance, marginalia might provide crucial commentary on the main text, and their placement relative to specific passages can be significant. **Ignoring or misinterpreting these elements can lead to a loss of valuable historical information and a distorted understanding of the document**. Therefore, robust methods for detecting, classifying, and appropriately processing non-textual elements are essential for comprehensive historical document analysis and reconstruction.

### 2.4 Synthetic Data Generation for VLM Training
**Synthetic data generation has emerged as a crucial technique for training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and OCR systems** to handle the unique challenges posed by historical documents, particularly their degraded quality and varied typography . Given the difficulty of acquiring large, accurately annotated real-world datasets, synthetic data offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative. The core idea is to **artificially create images of text that mimic the visual characteristics of historical documents**, including specific fonts, degradation patterns (like stains, ink bleed-through, faded text), and page layouts. This is typically achieved by starting with clean text, rendered in various historical or historically-inspired fonts, and then applying a series of image processing operations to introduce realistic degradations . For instance, the **PreP-OCR pipeline's synthetic data generation process begins by rendering multi-line text with stylistic variations** such as random indentation, character shifts, rotation, and bending, using a collection of **1,060 fonts** for different languages . This base image serves as the clean ground truth.

Subsequently, a sequence of controlled noise and distortion operations are applied to simulate real-world document aging and damage. These operations can include **adding random noise (e.g., Gaussian, salt-and-pepper), reducing resolution, applying blurring (e.g., Gaussian blur), overlaying artifacts like random black or white patches (simulating stains or holes), white or black lines (simulating scratches or folds), background textures, and specific degradation models for ink bleed-through or faded ink** . The PreP-OCR pipeline uses **four progressive degradation levels**, with higher levels introducing more aggressive distortions, applied in a random order to ensure diversity . Morphological operations like dilation and erosion are also used to simulate text imperfections . The Rényi AI group's framework similarly implements **over 30 distinct domain-specific noise types** . The resulting paired datasets (degraded images and their clean counterparts) are used to train image restoration models and OCR engines, significantly enhancing their performance on historical documents by making them more resilient to visual noise and font variations . This approach can also be extended to generate data for layout analysis and other VLM tasks requiring visual-textual understanding.

### 2.5 Advanced VLM Architectures and Techniques
The processing of historical documents, particularly handwritten text, necessitates **advanced Visual Language Model (VLM) architectures and techniques**. A key resource in this domain underscores the application of sophisticated models, including the integration of VLMs with **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, to address the complexities of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) in historical contexts . This combination is particularly relevant for historical documents, which often suffer from degradation, varied handwriting styles, and complex layouts. The use of GANs suggests a focus not only on recognition but potentially on the **generation or restoration of textual content or even document images**, aligning with the goal of generatively reconstructing damaged documents. The focus on "Historical Documents" implies that these VLMs and GANs are tailored or fine-tuned to handle the unique characteristics of such materials, moving beyond standard OCR techniques.

Further investigation into such methodologies is expected to reveal specific VLM architectures, such as **Transformer-based models**, which have shown remarkable success in various vision-language tasks. These models often employ **attention mechanisms to learn complex relationships between visual features** (e.g., characters, words, layout elements) and their textual representations. For historical documents, this could involve the VLM learning to attend to specific regions of a degraded page, distinguish text from background noise or illustrations, and understand the context provided by surrounding words or phrases, even if partially obscured or written in archaic scripts. The integration with GANs could serve multiple purposes: **generating synthetic training data that mimics historical degradation patterns**, thereby improving VLM robustness; or directly participating in reconstruction by inpainting damaged text regions or generating "clean" document images. The successful application of such advanced VLM and GAN techniques is pivotal for creating systems that can not only transcribe but also understand and reconstruct historical document content.

## 3. Language Model (LLM) Track: Understanding Historical Dialects
### 3.1 Addressing Inconsistent Spelling and Obsolete Words
A primary challenge for the LLM track in processing historical dialects is the **prevalence of inconsistent spelling and the use of obsolete words** no longer present in modern lexicons. Historical texts often reflect a period before standardized orthography, leading to significant variation in how words are spelled, even within the same document . This variability can confuse standard language models trained on contemporary text. Furthermore, historical documents frequently contain words that have fallen out of use or whose meanings have shifted, creating semantic gaps. Several approaches have been explored to address these issues. **Rule-based normalization methods**, for example, can be derived from parallel corpora of historical and modernized texts to map historical spellings to their modern equivalents . **Neural network architectures, particularly deep bi-LSTM networks operating at the character level**, have shown promise in historical spelling normalization, with multi-task learning using additional normalization data further improving performance . The "Ithaca" model, designed for ancient Greek inscriptions, uses a vocabulary that includes frequent words but renders damaged or under-represented words with an '[unk]' symbol, relying on character and word embeddings to be both character- and context-aware . For LLM fine-tuning, **generating synthetic historical text data that incorporates these spelling variations and archaic terms** could be beneficial, potentially using word morphing algorithms or neural networks trained to introduce plausible historical spelling variations into modern text.

### 3.2 Handling Non-Modern Grammar and Archaic Syntax
Historical dialects often exhibit **non-modern grammatical structures and archaic syntax** that differ significantly from contemporary language, posing a substantial challenge for LLMs primarily trained on modern text . These grammatical variations can include different verb conjugations, noun declensions, pronoun usage, sentence word order, and the use of particles or constructions that are no longer common. An LLM not attuned to these features may struggle to parse sentences correctly, leading to misinterpretations. A study evaluating fourteen foundation LLMs for post-correcting historical text transcripts found them **largely inefficient for this task due to the outdated grammatical structures and unfamiliar syntactic arrangements** . The authors noted that historical texts often contain a level and nature of noise that varies considerably, which LLMs may not have encountered extensively during training.

To mitigate these challenges, specialized adaptation techniques are required. One promising approach involves **"Context-Aware and Task-Specific Prompting with Iterative Refinement for Historical Texts"** . This method focuses on enhancing LLM performance by crafting detailed prompts that guide the model in understanding the specific characteristics of historical data. The core of this approach lies in providing the LLM with **contextual prompts**, such as background information relevant to the historical period (e.g., "Identify key entities in the following text from 18th-century France, considering the historical context of the French Revolution"), and **task-specific prompts** tailored for activities like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or sentiment analysis . Furthermore, an **iterative refinement process** is implemented where initial model outputs are analyzed to further refine the prompts, ensuring continuous improvement. This study also emphasizes the importance of **instruction tuning on data obtained using these crafted prompts**, which involves fine-tuning the LLMs to better adapt to the intricacies of historical texts, demonstrating significant improvements in handling historical texts .

### 3.3 Synthetic Data Generation for LLM Training
The generation of **synthetic data is a critical component for fine-tuning Language Models (LLMs)** to effectively understand and process historical dialects, especially when faced with challenges such as inconsistent spelling, obsolete vocabulary, and non-modern grammatical structures. The inherent scarcity of large, accurately transcribed historical text corpora necessitates using synthetic data to augment training datasets. One prominent method involves using **powerful generative AI models, such as GPT-4, to create synthetic query-text pairs or to introduce specific types of errors** common in historical texts or resulting from OCR processes . For instance, GPT-4 was employed to generate search queries based on document snippets for historical Swedish court records. However, this study highlighted potential pitfalls, such as generated queries sometimes being overly general or not perfectly aligned with historical nuances, underscoring the importance of **careful prompt engineering and potential post-processing** .

Another significant aspect is creating text that exhibits specific error patterns or linguistic variations. For developing a spelling and grammar correction LLM for Slovenian, researchers identified the need for a substantial dataset of typical language errors. Their methodology involved **combining authentic, manually corrected data with synthetically generated examples using LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini, guided by carefully designed prompts** to generate sentences with specific errors or in particular styles characteristic of historical writing . The **Hugging Face Synthetic Data Generator** provides a more general-purpose tool, allowing users to describe the desired dataset, including example use cases and text style, with iterative refinement capabilities . Projects like **Cosmopedia by Hugging Face** demonstrate methods for creating large-scale synthetic datasets, focusing on diverse topic coverage through meticulously crafted prompts, which could be adapted for historical dialects by grounding generation in retrieved, trustworthy historical information to mitigate hallucination . The process must also consider **"catastrophic forgetting"** if fine-tuning is not managed carefully, especially with AI-generated data of variable quality .

### 3.4 Fine-Tuning and Adapting LLMs for Historical Text
Fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs is a standard approach to adapt them for specific tasks or domains, including the interpretation and generation of historical text. However, this process presents unique challenges due to the linguistic distance of historical dialects from modern languages, the prevalence of archaic features, and often limited high-quality training data. A key consideration is managing **"catastrophic forgetting,"** where the model loses previously learned general knowledge during fine-tuning on a new, specialized dataset. A study fine-tuning the BGE M3-Embedding model for historical Swedish court records, using GPT-4 generated data, observed such catastrophic forgetting, where the model "forgot more than it learned" . This was attributed to difficulties in NLP for historical text (HTR errors, semantic diversity, linguistic under-representation), the quality of AI-generated training queries, and potentially suboptimal training methods.

To counteract catastrophic forgetting and improve fine-tuning efficacy, several strategies can be explored. **Adjusting hyperparameters**, such as using a bigger batch size or a slower warm-up rate for the learning rate scheduler, might lead to better models . **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, reduce trainable parameters by freezing original model weights and injecting trainable rank decomposition matrices, potentially acting as a regularizer and preserving general knowledge . The nature and quality of fine-tuning data are paramount; synthetic data should be carefully curated. If the base LLM has little exposure to the historical language, it may struggle even after fine-tuning. Strategies like using "corrected or modernized historical text" or specialized tokenizers asseeninaVLMcontextwhereahistorical-specifictokenizerimprovedperformance might be beneficial. The specific architecture and pre-training objectives of the LLM also influence adaptability. Models like M3-Embedding, combining dense, multi-vector, and sparse retrieval, offer flexibility, with dense and multi-vector methods often preferable for historical text retrieval .

## 4. Integrated Approaches for Document Reconstruction
### 4.1 Synergistic OCR and LLM Integration
The integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a **promising synergistic approach to improving the accuracy and reliability of text extraction from historical documents**, especially those that are severely damaged or feature complex linguistic characteristics . Traditional OCR engines can struggle with historical degradations, leading to errors. LLMs, with their advanced NLP capabilities, can post-process and correct these OCR outputs. An LLM can interpret unclear text segments, identify and rectify recognition errors by considering context, and even reconstruct missing or heavily damaged text . For example, the **PreP-OCR pipeline incorporates a ByT5 post-OCR correction module** that semantically recovers errors, even with severely degraded images . This two-stage process—image restoration followed by LLM refinement of OCR output—significantly reduces character error rates (CER) . The paper "Enhancing Text Recognition of Damaged Documents through Synergistic OCR and Large Language Models" explicitly explores this combination . This collaborative workflow allows each component to play to its strengths: OCR for character/word recognition and LLM for higher-level linguistic understanding and error correction.

Several studies highlight the practical benefits of this integration. An information extraction workflow for historical well records used OCR to convert documents into text, which was then processed by pre-trained LLMs with designed prompts to extract specific data . The **AutoHDR framework** uses OCR-assisted damage localization as a critical first step, identifying legible parts and those requiring LLM processing for content prediction . The PreP-OCR pipeline also exemplifies this synergy with its image restoration and ByT5 post-corrector stages . The choice of OCR engine and LLM can impact performance; one study found **ABBYY FineReader with GPT-4 Omni (as UHHGPT) optimal for vocational education documents** , suggesting effectiveness can be dataset-dependent, necessitating careful component selection and fine-tuning.

### 4.2 Vision-Language Context Prediction for Content Restoration
**Vision-Language Context Prediction (VLCP) is a sophisticated technique within integrated document restoration frameworks**, designed to predict missing or damaged text by jointly considering visual information from the document image and linguistic context from surrounding text. This is crucial for historical documents where damage can render characters illegible. The core idea, as in **AutoHDR**, is to leverage both OCR and LLMs . The process starts with OCR attempting character recognition. For lightly damaged content, OCR might provide reasonably accurate, albeit low-confidence, identifications. The **VLCP algorithm uses a predefined OCR threshold to determine reliably recognized characters**. Characters below this confidence threshold are flagged as "severely damaged" and predicted by an LLM. The LLM, fine-tuned on historical texts, uses surrounding, reliably OCR'd text as context to generate predictions for damaged portions .

The VLCP algorithm in AutoHDR involves a structured decision-making process with parameters like an **OCR threshold (τ), weights for OCR and LM scores (w<sub>o</sub>, w<sub>l</sub>), a ranking score weight (α), a matching bonus (β), and a TopK value (k)** to balance visual recognition and linguistic prediction . If the OCR score for a character is above τ, it's accepted; otherwise, the LLM predicts. The final candidate score (s<sub>c</sub>) is a weighted combination of OCR and LLM scores, with refinements for ranking and matching. This allows a nuanced approach, prioritizing visual evidence when strong and linguistic context when visual cues are weak. AutoHDR authors note that for **severely damaged documents, higher weights should be assigned to the language model**, while for less damaged documents, higher weights can favor the OCR model . This adaptive weighting optimizes performance across varying degradation levels, aiming for more accurate and contextually plausible restorations.

### 4.3 Generative Reconstruction and Inpainting Techniques
**Generative reconstruction and inpainting techniques are increasingly vital for restoring the visual integrity and textual content of damaged historical documents**. These methods go beyond simple noise reduction or binarization, aiming to **synthesize plausible reconstructions of missing or severely degraded portions of a document image or its text**. For visual restoration, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models are prominent. GANs, with their generator-discriminator architecture, can be trained to generate realistic pixel data to fill in tears, stains, or faded areas, ensuring the inpainted regions blend seamlessly with the original document's aged appearance . Diffusion models, which iteratively denoise an image, have also shown remarkable success in generating high-fidelity image restorations. The **PreP-OCR pipeline, for instance, employs a diffusion-based model (ResShift) trained on synthetically generated paired data** to improve visual clarity . These techniques can recreate not just background texture but also plausible character strokes, making text legible again.

For textual content, LLMs themselves act as generative models for reconstruction. When OCR fails or when text is entirely missing, an LLM fine-tuned on historical corpora can **predict the missing words or passages based on the surrounding context**. This is a form of textual inpainting. The **AutoHDR framework's Damaged Content Prediction (DCP) module leverages an LLM for this purpose**, fine-tuning it on pairwise damaged-restored text data to predict missing content . The synergy with VLCP, which combines OCR's partial recognitions with LLM predictions, further refines this generative process . The goal is to produce a complete and coherent textual representation of the document, even if parts were initially unreadable. These generative approaches are powerful but also require careful validation to ensure historical accuracy and avoid introducing anachronistic or incorrect information, often benefiting from human-in-the-loop verification.

### 4.4 Comprehensive Frameworks (e.g., AutoHDR, PreP-OCR)
Comprehensive frameworks like **AutoHDR and PreP-OCR represent holistic approaches to historical document restoration**, integrating multiple stages from image enhancement to textual reconstruction and correction. These frameworks address multifaceted challenges including physical degradation, outdated fonts, complex layouts, and archaic language.

*Table 1: Comparison of Comprehensive Frameworks for Historical Document Restoration*

**AutoHDR** aims for a comprehensive restoration that includes semantic content prediction and visual appearance reconstruction, mimicking the historian's workflow . Its three-stage pipeline involves OCR-assisted damage localization, Damaged Content Prediction (DCP) using an LLM (like Qwen2) fine-tuned on historical texts, and Historical Appearance Restoration using a patch autoregressive approach. It also introduces the FPHDR dataset and a Variant-based Data Augmentation (VDA) method for LLM robustness .

**PreP-OCR** focuses on a two-stage process combining document image restoration with semantic-aware post-OCR correction . The first stage uses a synthetic-data-driven approach to train an image restoration model (e.g., ResShift, a diffusion model) on images with diverse typography and degradations. The second stage employs a ByT5 model, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text pairs, to correct residual OCR errors . This pipeline has demonstrated significant CER reductions on real historical documents . Both frameworks highlight the trend towards end-to-end solutions leveraging synthetic data, advanced image processing, and linguistic post-correction.

## 5. Methodologies for Data Generation and Model Fine-Tuning
### 5.1 Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Strategies
**Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning strategies are crucial for historical document processing due to the scarcity of large, accurately labeled datasets.** Semi-supervised learning leverages a small amount of labeled data alongside a larger pool of unlabeled data. For instance, an initial model could be trained on a limited set of transcribed historical pages and then used to predict labels for unlabeled pages. These pseudo-labels can then be used to further train the model, often after a confidence thresholding or filtering step to ensure quality. This iterative process can significantly expand the effective training set. **Active learning**, a form of semi-supervised learning, involves the model identifying the most informative unlabeled examples for human annotation, optimizing the labeling effort. For VLMs, this could mean selecting document images where the OCR model is least confident, or where layout analysis is most ambiguous. For LLMs, it might involve identifying text passages with the most unusual or diverse linguistic features for expert review.

**Unsupervised learning techniques aim to discover patterns and structures in data without any labels.** For historical documents, this could involve using clustering algorithms to group similar handwriting styles or document layouts, or dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize the distribution of linguistic features in a historical text corpus. While not directly producing a transcription or translation model, these methods can provide valuable insights for downstream tasks, help in data exploration, or identify anomalies. For example, topic modeling on a collection of unlabeled historical texts can reveal thematic trends. **Weak labeling strategies**, often used in conjunction with semi-supervised learning, involve using heuristics or noisy sources to generate approximate labels for unlabeled data. For instance, the output of a baseline OCR system, even if imperfect, can serve as weak labels for training a more robust OCR model. Similarly, dictionary-based lookups or simple rule-based systems could provide initial, noisy labels for historical spellings or named entities, which can then be refined. These strategies are essential for making the most of limited annotated resources.

### 5.2 Synthetic Data Generation for Linguistic and Visual Challenges
**Synthetic data generation is a cornerstone methodology for addressing both the linguistic peculiarities of historical dialects (LLM track) and the visual degradation of historical documents (VLM track)**, especially given the scarcity and high cost of labeled real-world data. For the VLM track, the focus is on creating images that mimic
