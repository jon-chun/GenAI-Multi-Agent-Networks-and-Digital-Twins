# VEHICLE DESCRIPTIONS

**Vehicle 1 (Honda Pilot):**

* Color: Black
* Direction of travel: Northbound uphill toward the Acland/Wiggin St intersection
* Approximate speed: 20mph. Enforced by surrounding cars ahead, cars behind, and speed hump just before the parking lot.
* Actions before impact: 
The Honda was lawfully traveling in the designated northbound traffic lane with full right-of-way. When the Toyota suddenly began backing into the travel lane directly in front of our Honda, I immediately took evasive action by steering toward the center line while remaining in the travel lane. The collision occurred approximately 2-3 seconds after the Toyota began backing into the travel lane, providing minimal time for collision avoidance.

**Vehicle 2 (Toyota RAV4):**

* Color: Black
* Direction of travel: Backing into two way traffic on Acland St. from a parking spot in front of Kenyon College's Acland Apartments.
* Approximate speed: 5-10 mph
* Actions before impact: 
The Toyota violated Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.38 by failing to yield right-of-way when backing from a parking space into a public roadway. The Toyota driver failed to check mirrors, look over her shoulder, or otherwise ensure the roadway was clear before backing into traffic, despite having clear sight lines to observe through traffic.

# INCIDENT DESCRIPTION

* What did you see happen? (Please describe in detail)

While traveling northbound in the designated traffic lane with full right-of-way, a Toyota suddenly backed out of a parking space directly into the path of our Honda. Despite immediate evasive action, the collision could not be avoided due to the Toyota's failure to yield right-of-way to through traffic. Ohio law requires vehicles backing from parking spaces to yield to through traffic.

* What actions did you see the Honda Pilot driver take? 

I took immediate and reasonable evasive action by steering toward the center line while maintaining position in the travel lane. This response was appropriate given the sudden nature of the Toyota's backing maneuver. The Honda's evasive action was immediate and reasonable under the circumstances, demonstrating proper defensive driving while maintaining legal right-of-way.

* What actions did you see the Toyota RAV4 driver take? 

The Toyota driver failed to check mirrors, look over her shoulder, or otherwise ensure the roadway was clear before backing into traffic, despite having clear sight lines to observe through traffic. The Toyota driver had delayed response in realizing she had struck another vehicle and continued backing into the Honda before coming to a stop.

* Did you see the Toyota backing up? If so, describe: 

Yes, the Toyota suddenly backed directly into the travel lane where our Honda was lawfully traveling. The collision occurred within seconds of the Toyota beginning to back into the roadway.

* Where did the vehicles make contact? 

These are documented in the photos attached. The rear passenger corner is the only visible damage to the Toyota and the point that was sticking out furthest into traffic on Acland Street. On the Honda, the rear corner of the Toyota dented the passenger front and rear doors, and rear quarter panels.

* What happened immediately after the collision? 

After both vehicles came to a stop, we quickly separated to allow backed up cars to pass and clear the road. No one was injured and we exchanged information. Kenyon Campus Safety and the Knox County Sheriffs arrived within minutes.

# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS

* Did you hear any sounds (brakes, horns, etc.)? 

I heard my passenger shout moments before impact.

* Did you observe any driver behavior that seemed unusual? 

The Toyota driver appeared to back into busy two-way traffic without checking for oncoming vehicles. The Toyota driver had delayed response in recognizing the collision and stopping after initial contact.

* Were there any traffic control devices (signs, lights) in the area? 

Yes, Acland St. is well marked with signage and there is a speed hump just before the Acland St. Apartment parking spots to slow traffic before these parking areas.

* Did you take any photos or videos? 

Yes, (see 16 photos in Google Drive at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-kSuDArXRE8ce0wppDx-h7MhyJZpA3uW?usp=drive_link) 

* Were there any other witnesses? 

Yes, will forward later.

# DECLARATION

I hereby declare that the above information is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and recollection. The Toyota driver's failure to yield right-of-way to through traffic was the sole proximate cause of this collision. I am willing to provide additional information if needed.
