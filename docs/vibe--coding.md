# Vibe Architecting: Technical Documentation

## Overview

Vibe Architecting is a structured approach to AI-assisted coding that improves upon the concept of "Vibe Coding" (letting an AI agent code freely while hoping for the best). This method provides a systematic six-step workflow that combines human creativity with AI capabilities to produce higher-quality software.

As described in the original explanation: "vibe coding is often just this term coined by Hrikarthy where you let the agent completely do its thing you hope for the best you go with flow vibe with the code you can get pretty awesome results but what will often end up happening is that you will hit a wall where the quality of everything will start to crumble your code will get erased."

This document provides a comprehensive guide for developers new to the method, with practical examples and use cases derived from real implementations.

## The Six-Step Process

### Step 1: Brainstorm Your Idea

**Purpose**: Establish clear product vision and scope while leveraging human creativity.

**Process**:
1. Document your product idea manually (application, game, website)
2. Express your vision in detail while keeping scope realistic
3. Focus on creative aspects that AI can't fully replicate
4. Include product details, features, and potential technical choices
5. Avoid planning too far into the future

**Example Content from Brainstorming**:
```
I want to build a YouTube channel manager that will:
- Upload videos automatically
- Generate and post video descriptions
- Manage posting announcements on X, LinkedIn, and BlueSky
- Run locally on my machine
- Use MCP framework for the backend
- Possibly use JavaScript with Nest framework
- Support automatic transcription for better content understanding
```

**Key Principle**: _"Large language models are simply an interface that use words to produce an output... it is this creativity which will get you the best results."_

### Step 2: Deep Research

After refining the brainstorming document into a research prompt, we'll use a research-oriented AI tool to gather comprehensive information. The research prompt might look like this:

```
Research Prompt:
Based on my YouTube Channel Manager idea, please conduct comprehensive research on:

1. Technical feasibility - specifically regarding:
   - YouTube API capabilities and limitations for uploading
   - Social media API integration (X, LinkedIn, BlueSky)
   - Content analysis tools and transcription options
   - MCP framework compatibility with these requirements

2. Existing solutions:
   - Similar tools in the market
   - Best practices for YouTube channel management
   - Common approaches to content management workflow

3. Implementation considerations:
   - Data storage requirements
   - Authentication and security concerns
   - Performance optimization for media processing

Please include specific libraries, frameworks, and services that would be beneficial.
```

The deep research output would include detailed information on APIs, libraries, frameworks, competitors, and technical considerations - much more comprehensive than what could be included here.

**Purpose**: Gather comprehensive technical context and implementation details.

**Process**:
1. Refine your brainstorming document into a research prompt
2. Use research-oriented AI tools (OpenAI Deep Research, Gemini, Perplexity)
3. Request a product/technical research document
4. Review and customize the research plan if needed

**Example Research Prompt**:
```
I need a comprehensive research plan for building a YouTube channel manager. The core requirements are:
- Local application for managing YouTube content
- Video upload automation
- Cross-platform social media posting (X, LinkedIn, BlueSky)
- Automatic transcription for content understanding
- Using MCP framework

Research should cover:
1. Technical feasibility and architecture options
2. API requirements for YouTube and social platforms
3. Best practices for media handling and transcription
4. Similar existing products and their approaches
5. Potential technical challenges and solutions
```

**Expected Output**: A detailed document covering technical approaches, APIs, best practices, competitor analysis, and potential challenges.

**Key Principle**: _"The more proper context, focused and good context you give to your vibe coding agents, the better results are."_

### Step 3: Create a Structured Implementation Plan

**Purpose**: Break down the project into manageable, prioritized tasks.

**Process**:
1. Use a "thinking model" AI (Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, OpenAI-1)
2. Provide all previous documents (brainstorm and research)
3. Request a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD)
4. Ask AI to convert the PRD into specific tickets organized as epics

**Example Prompt**:
```
You are a technical lead. You will be given three documents:
1. The original brainstorming document for a YouTube channel manager
2. The technical research document
3. The formal PRD

Your goal is to cut this project into specific tickets following software engineering best practices. For each ticket:
1. Create an epic (group of related tickets)
2. Define individual tickets with clear requirements
3. Include acceptance criteria for each ticket
4. Prioritize tickets based on dependencies and value

Please provide the output in a format that could be directly imported into a ticket management system like Jira.
```

**Expected Output**: A structured set of epics and tickets with detailed requirements and acceptance criteria.

**Sample Ticket Structure**:
```
EPIC 1: Core Application Setup
  Ticket 1.1: Initialize MCP Framework
    Description: Set up the base MCP application with proper configuration
    Acceptance Criteria:
    - Application runs locally
    - Basic configuration is in place
    - Project structure follows best practices
    Priority: High

  Ticket 1.2: Implement Local Database
    Description: Set up local SQLite database for storing video metadata
    Acceptance Criteria:
    - Database schema created
    - CRUD operations working
    - Data persistence verified
    Priority: High

EPIC 2: Video Management
  Ticket 2.1: Video Transcription Service
    Description: Implement automatic transcription of uploaded videos
    Acceptance Criteria:
    - Use Grock API for whisper implementation
    - Generate accurate transcription from video files
    - Save transcripts alongside video metadata
    - Support processing of MP4 and other common formats
    Priority: Medium
```

**Key Principle**: _"You could let the research go loose, you can go wide or can focus it. But I think by using that technique of getting a proper research plan done, you'll get better results."_

### Step 4: Refine Each Ticket

**Purpose**: Enhance ticket details and build domain knowledge.

**Process**:
1. Take one ticket at a time
2. Do additional research (Deep Research, Perplexity, Google)
3. Review and modify requirements as needed
4. Remove unnecessary complexity
5. Add specific implementation details

**Example Ticket Refinement**:
Original Ticket:
```
Ticket 2.1: Video Transcription Service
Description: Implement automatic transcription of uploaded videos
Acceptance Criteria:
- Use OpenAI Whisper or alternative transcription to generate audio from video
- Support multiple languages
- Implement queue system for processing multiple videos
- Performance optimization and accuracy testing
- Use FFmpeg for video processing
- Support Whisper.cpp for local implementation
- Add GPU acceleration for faster processing
- Implement queue management system for trusted jobs
```

Refined Ticket:
```
Ticket 2.1: Video Transcription Service
Description: Implement automatic transcription of uploaded videos
Acceptance Criteria:
- Use Grock API for whisper implementation
- Generate accurate transcription from video files
- Save transcripts alongside video metadata
- Use FFmpeg for video processing
- Support English language only for initial version
```

**Key Principle**: _"If you don't understand the end result, what you're expecting, you will not get good results."_

### Step 5: Vibe Code Individual Tickets

**Purpose**: Implement tickets with AI assistance while maintaining control.

**Process**:
1. Use coding agent tools (Klein, Cursor, GitHub Copilot)
2. Present the refined ticket to the AI
3. Let the AI plan implementation and ask clarifying questions
4. Allow AI to implement code with supervision
5. Test code manually as it develops
6. Fix issues through iterative feedback

**Example AI Coding Session (Using Klein)**:
```
Human: I need to implement this ticket:

Ticket 2.1: Video Transcription Service
Description: Implement automatic transcription of uploaded videos
Acceptance Criteria:
- Use Grock API for whisper implementation
- Generate accurate transcription from video files
- Save transcripts alongside video metadata
- Use FFmpeg for video processing
- Support English language only for initial version

AI: I'll help you implement this transcription service. Let me scan your codebase to understand the current structure.

[AI analyzes codebase]

I propose the following implementation plan:
1. Create a transcription.service.js module
2. Use FFmpeg to extract audio from video files
3. Send audio to Grock API for transcription
4. Save the transcript to the database
5. Add error handling and logging

Does this approach sound good? Also, I have a few questions:
- Do you already have FFmpeg installed?
- Do you have a Grock API key?
- Where should the transcripts be saved - database, filesystem, or both?
