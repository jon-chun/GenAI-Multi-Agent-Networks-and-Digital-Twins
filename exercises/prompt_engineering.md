# LLM Prompt Engineering Exercises

1. **Hallucination Detection**
   - Prompt the LLM with a question about a fictional event or person.
   - Analyze the response for signs of hallucination.
   - Modify the prompt to encourage the LLM to admit uncertainty.

2. **Fact-Checking Challenge**
   - Provide a mix of true and false statements to the LLM.
   - Ask it to verify each statement and explain its reasoning.
   - Compare the LLM's responses to reliable sources.

3. **Bias Identification**
   - Create prompts on sensitive topics (e.g., gender, race, politics).
   - Analyze responses for potential biases.
   - Rewrite prompts to encourage more balanced responses.

4. **Sycophancy Mitigation**
   - Design a series of prompts with increasingly unreasonable requests.
   - Observe how the LLM responds.
   - Develop strategies to encourage the LLM to push back appropriately.

5. **Logical Reasoning Enhancement**
   - Present a complex logical puzzle to the LLM.
   - Analyze its initial approach and solution.
   - Use step-by-step prompting to guide the LLM through a more structured reasoning process.

6. **Context Window Optimization**
   - Provide a long, detailed prompt that exceeds the LLM's context window.
   - Ask questions that require information from different parts of the prompt.
   - Experiment with summarization and chunking techniques to fit more context.

7. **Consistency Check**
   - Ask the LLM a series of related questions in different ways.
   - Identify any inconsistencies in the responses.
   - Develop prompting strategies to maintain consistency across interactions.

8. **Mathematical Accuracy Improvement**
   - Present increasingly complex math problems to the LLM.
   - Analyze where it starts to make mistakes.
   - Experiment with different prompting techniques (e.g., step-by-step, visual representations) to improve accuracy.

9. **Source Attribution Exercise**
   - Ask the LLM to provide information on a specific topic.
   - Request sources for its claims.
   - Develop prompts that encourage the LLM to distinguish between factual knowledge and potential speculation.

10. **Ambiguity Resolution**
    - Create prompts with deliberate ambiguities.
    - Observe how the LLM handles unclear instructions.
    - Refine the prompts to reduce ambiguity and improve response quality.

11. **Ethical Decision-Making**
    - Present ethical dilemmas to the LLM.
    - Analyze its decision-making process and justifications.
    - Experiment with prompts that encourage consideration of multiple ethical frameworks.

12. **Creative Writing Control**
    - Provide a creative writing prompt with specific constraints (e.g., genre, tone, length).
    - Evaluate how well the LLM adheres to the constraints.
    - Refine prompting techniques to achieve desired creative outcomes while maintaining control.

13. **Cross-Language Consistency**
    - Present the same prompt in multiple languages.
    - Compare responses for consistency and quality across languages.
    - Develop strategies for maintaining consistent performance in multilingual contexts.

14. **Temporal Awareness**
    - Ask questions about current events or future predictions.
    - Analyze how the LLM handles time-sensitive information.
    - Experiment with prompts that clearly establish the temporal context.

15. **Prompt Injection Defense**
    - Attempt various prompt injection techniques to manipulate the LLM's behavior.
    - Develop and test prompting strategies to defend against such manipulations.
