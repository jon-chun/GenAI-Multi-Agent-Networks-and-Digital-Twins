## Syllabus Description

This upper-division course offers an in-depth exploration of advanced AI concepts, focusing on interdisciplinary applications of large language models, AI information systems, and autonomous agents. Over 15 weeks, students will engage with a progressive curriculum, starting with a review of Python and a series of four hands-on projects:

1. **OpenAI API programming a GPT-based chatbot**
2. **Mechanistic interpretations of transformer internals using Huggingface Transformers**
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain**
4. **Simulations of autonomous multi-agent systems using AutoGen**

The course includes four substantive subprojects and one final project, enabling students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world AI challenges. This course is designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to innovate in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, emphasizing both technical proficiency and ethical considerations.

**Note:** These four broad frontiers of AI research are rapidly evolving. Since this course will begin 9 months after this syllabus was written, expect updates to reflect the most recent AI research breakthroughs, tooling, and industry best practices as of August 2024.

## How This Course Fits Into Curriculum

This course focuses on 4 key leading-edge AI technologies that implement practical real-world research and industry solutions for fields like medicine, law, or public policy. It differs from the survey AI course (IPHS300 AI for the Humanities) by offering a focused exploration of these advanced AI technologies.

## Special Topic

These are all very new AI technologies that have only recently matured and gained traction in both research and industry. A special topics course allows Kenyon to provide students with direct exposure to these cutting-edge AI technologies, which are invaluable in research and industry but evolving too quickly to have been formalized into any fixed course or textbook. This framework around rapid AI change will eventually help develop a permanent course.
